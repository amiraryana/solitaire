will remain face up until you find a non-sequential card. When
this happens, all the cards will turn face down. For example: if
at the start of the game you find an Ace, it will remain face up
until you find the 2. If the next card you turn over is not a 2,
all the cards will turn face down and you will need to start
over.</p>

Set-Up: At the beginning of the game, four Kings (one of each suit) and four Aces (one
of each suit) are removed from the stock and placed in the eight piles at the
bottom, becoming the foundations.</p>
<p><strong>Foundations</strong>
(8
piles:
complete these
piles
to win the game)</p>
<p>Build the Ace foundations
up
in suit from Ace
to King (for example, a 2
can be played only on an Ace).</p>
<p>Build the King foundations
down in suit from
King to Ace (for example, a Queen
can be played only on a King).</p>
<p>Reversal. When the top cards of two foundations
of the same suit are in sequence, one or more cards from one
pile may be transferred to the other, except for the Ace or King
at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong>
(4
columns of 12 cards each)</p>
<p>The top card of each
column is
available for play to the foundations
only.</p>
<p>No building on the

<p><strong>Reserve</strong> (13
piles in the form of a
semicircular arch, each containing a variable number of cards)</p>
<p>Each pile is
reserved for cards of the same
rank, starting from Aces to
Kings. There will be different numbers in different
piles depending on
how many cards of one rank remain after the
tableau piles are
dealt, and some ranks may not be represented at all.</p>
<p>All the cards in each
reserve pile, not just the top cards, are
available for play to the
foundations only.</p>
<p>Click on a reserve pile to spread its cards in the center in the
form of a fan. Then, all the cards of the
fan are available for
play.</p>
<p>No building on the reserve.</p>

<p><strong>Tableau</strong>
(4
rows of 13 cards each)</p>
<p>Build all the cards on the
tableau regardless of
suit, doubling the value of the card that is already placed in the corresponding
column. If the double of a card exceeds 13, the excess of the double over 13 denotes the card required.
Example. If the tableau card is a 6, you can play a 12
(Queen) on it. The double of 12 (Queen) is 24. This is 11 more
than 13 and the next required card must be an 11 (Jack). The
vertical sequence of cards is the following:
2, 4, 8, 3, 6, Q (12),
J (11), 9, 5, 10, 7, A</p>
<p>The last
column is reserved for the four Kings.</p>

<p><strong>Object of the game</strong>: To reach the highest possible score.</p>
<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong></p>
<p>A card&#39;s value is the same as its
rank with the exception of the 10, J, Q and K whose values are zero. If the
sum of the first two cards is higher than 9 you must subtract 10. For example:
6+8 = 14. Your score = 4.</p>
<p>Click on the stock (52 cards) to deal the first 2 cards.</p>
<p>If the sum of the values of the
cards is 9, click on the
waste. The cards
will transfer to the
waste and their
values will be totaled.</p>
<p>If the sum of the values of the
cards is low (for example: 9+2 = 1, value = 1), you can choose
risking the deal of another card or stopping.</p>
<p>If you choose risking the deal of
another card, click on the
stock. If the sum
of the values of the three cards is 10, your score is 0. If it
is higher than 10, subtract 10 and the resulting total is your
score. If it is 9 or lower, that is your score. Continue in this
manner until the

To discard all the cards of the

<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong></p>
<p>Set Up</p>
<p>Each pyramid is formed by 15 cards. At the start of the game, 5
cards are dealt face up to the 5th
row, leaving 10
empty spaces in the above
rows.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> (15 piles)</p>
<p>Each pyramid must be built,
row by
row, from bottom to top.</p>
<p>For each pair of cards in a lower
row, place a card with a value equal to the sum of the pair in the
row above.</p>
<p>When the sum exceeds 13, the value of the required card is found by subtracting 13 from the sum (for example, if the sum is 23, that is 10 more than 13, the required card must be a 10).</p>
<p>The following is an example of a complete pyramid:</p>
<p>In the above scheme, the 6 in the 4th
row has been placed above the 10 and the 9 of the 5th
row because 10 + 9 = 19; 19 - 13 = 6.</p>
<p>When a pyramid is complete, it is automatically discarded (to the top-right
pile).</p>
<p>Five more cards are automatically dealt from the
stock to the bottom pyramid
row.</p>

<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the eight Aces
are dealt as indicator cards in a row called &quot;indicator row&quot;. They take
no active part in the game.</p>
<p>Deal cards, one at a time, by clicking on
the
stock.</p>
<p>Whenever a card is of the same suit as the Ace vertically above it in the indicator row, the
card can be discarded.</p>
<p>You can interchange the position of two
cards in order to match the Ace&#39;s
suit
and discard them.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> cards may be interchanged only if after the exchange the
suit
of the starting and the destination cards matches the suits
of the Aces in the indicator row. To interchange two cards, drag and
drop one card on the other.</p>
<p>The exchange can be done between two cards
of any
tableau row, not necessarily the same
row.</p>
<p>To win the game you must discard the entire stock.</p>
<p>There is no redeal.</p>

<p><strong>Object of the game</strong>: To create four suit sequences of 12 cards from Two to King.</p>
<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong>
The whole stock
is dealt in four rows of 13 cards each. Then the four Aces are removed,
creating four gaps in the layout.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> (4 rows of 13 cards each)</p>
<p>A gap (four in all) must be filled with the card that is the next highest in rank and of the same suit to the card on the left of the gap. (For example: if a gap opens up to the right of the 10, it
must be filled by the Jack.
The gap and the Jack will exchange places).</p>
<p>A gap in the
first space of a row may be filled with any Two. The player decides which row he will allocate to each
suit.</p>
<p>Because a King is the highest-ranking card, a gap after a King cannot be filled and action is blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>After all possible plays have been made (when the Kings block any action), click the
redeal button.</p>
<p>Redeals are performed as follows:</p>
<p>Any Two and the
suit
sequences starting with them are left in place.</p>
<p>All other cards that are out of sequence are removed, shuffled and then dealt to complete the rows.</p>
<p>A gap is left to the immediate right of the cards that are in
suit
sequence in each row (if the only card in place is a Two, a gap is left to the right of it).</p>
<p>If there is no Two in a row, a gap is left in the first place of the row, so that a Two can be moved in.</p>
<p>Two redeals are permitted (three deals in all).</p>

<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong></p>
<p><strong>Foundations</strong>  (8 piles: complete these piles to win the game)</p>
<p>There are two foundation columns (the left and the right), each containing 4 cards.</p>
<p><strong>Foundations</strong>  can be whatever cards you choose, but you must select any two consecutive
ranks.</p>
<p>For example, if you choose a 10 for the left
columns, you must choose a Jack for the right
column.</p>
<p>Build the foundations up in suit by twos from the
base cards until each pile contains 13 cards.</p>
<p>For example, if the left
column starts with a 10, the sequence will be:
10, Q, A, 3, 5, 7, 9,
J, K, 2, 4, 6, 8.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong> (2 rows of 4 cards each, called the &quot;rails&quot;)</p>
<p>Build down in
alternating colors (for example, a 10 can be played on a Jack).</p>
<p>An entire
built unit of cards in the proper sequence may be moved in whole to another
tableau pile.</p>
<p>Spaces are filled starting with the bottom card of the
reserve and working upwards.After
the reserve is exhausted, spaces are filled from the
waste.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>There are two
reserve wings (the left and the right), each containing 16 cards.</p>
<p>The two wings have different rules: one will have filled spaces, the other one will be diminishing.</p>
<p>By moving the first card, you decide which wing will be the filled or the diminishing one.</p>
<p>If the first card moved is from the lowest
row of a wing, that wing will be the diminishing one.</p>
<p>If the first card moved is from the first, second or third
row of a wing, that wing will be the filled one.</p>
<p>Filled Reserve (16 cards in 4 rows of 4)</p>
<p>All these cards are available for play to the
foundations.</p>
<p>Each
pile can contain only one card.</p>
<p>No building on these
piles.</p>
<p>Spaces are automatically filled from the
waste, or if empty, from the
stock.</p>
<p>Diminishing Reserve (16 cards in 4 rows of 4)</p>
<p>Only the cards in the bottom
row are initially available for play to the
foundations.</p>
<p>The cards in the
rows above them may only be played as they are exposed.</p>

Rules
Set-Up: A King is removed from the deck and placed as the first foundation.</p>
<p>Foundation (Eight piles)</p>
<p>After the King, foundations must be placed in strict sequence
from Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 to 6, as they become available. For
example, the Jack foundation cannot be placed until the Queen
foundation is in place.</p>
<p>These eight cards from K to 6 are called &quot;origins&quot;. All
&quot;origins&quot; must be placed, in order, before foundation building
can start.</p>
<p>Build down, regardless of suit until each pile contains thirteen
cards. The end product is a row of eight piles of thirteen
cards, in order from A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8 and 7.</p>
<p>Ranking of cards is continuous: build Kings after Aces.</p>

<p><strong>Skill level</strong>: Skill</p>
<p><strong>Chance of winning</strong>: Low (about 1 in 25)</p>
<p><strong>Object of the game</strong>:
To arrange the 48 cards into 4
ascending suit
sequences, each
from Ace to Queen, from left to right.</p>
<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong></p>
<p>The whole stock is dealt in six rows, the first and the second of 8 cards each, the
third, fourth, fifth and sixth of 9 cards each. Then the four Kings are removed, creating
four gaps in the layout (making six gaps in all).</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> (6 rows)</p>
<p>A gap must be filled with a card from anywhere on the layout provided it is in
suit sequence - either one higher than the card to the left of the gap to which it is being moved, or one lower than the card to the right of the gap - whichever is more
advantageous.</p>
<p>When a gap appears to the right of a Queen, it may be filled with an Ace of different
suit (even if there is not yet a neighboring 2), or with a card one lower in
suit sequence than the card to the right of the gap itself - whichever is more advantageous.</p>
<p>Only one card at a time may be moved.</p>
<p>The game is won if all the cards are arranged into four
ascending suit sequences (each from Ace to Queen) starting with an Ace in the top left-hand corner to a Queen in the extreme
right-hand position of the sixth row. The
suits
can be in any order. Note: The top left-hand card in the first row follows the same rules as the other cards. For example: if the last card in the sixth row is a 4, and the top left-hand space is empty, you can move the 5  to that space.</p>
<p>The entire 48 card sequence &quot;reads&quot;, as in reading and writing, from left to right in each row, and from the top row downwards. The first card in the first row follows the last card in the sixth row.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty level</strong>: Easy</p>

<p><strong>Chance of winning</strong>: Low (about 1 in 20)</p>
<p><strong>Object of the game</strong>: Create four suit sequences of twelve cards each, from Two to King.
Set-Up:
The entire stock is dealt in four rows of thirteen cards each. Then the four Aces are removed, creating four gaps in the layout.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> (Four rows of twelve cards each)</p>
<p>A gap (four in all) must be filled with the card that is the next highest in rank and of the same suit as the card to the left of the gap. For example, if a gap opens up to the right of the 10, it must be filled with the Jack. The gap and the Jack will exchange places.</p>
<p>A gap in the first space of a row may be filled with any Two. The player decides which row he will allocate to each suit.</p>
<p>Because a King is the highest–ranking card, a gap after a King cannot be filled and action is blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>After all possible plays have been made (when the Kings block any action), click the
redeal button.
Redeals are performed as follows:</p>
<p>Any Two and the suit sequences starting with them are left in place.</p>
<p>All other cards that are out of sequence are removed, and without shuffling them, dealt to complete the rows.</p>
<p>A gap is left to the immediate right of the cards that are in suit sequence in each row. If the only card in place is a Two, the gap will be to the right of it.</p>
<p>If there is no Two in a row, a gap is left in the first place of the row, so that a Two can be moved there.</p>
<p>Two redeals are permitted (three deals in all).</p>

<p>Deal the cards to the right of the Q  in a horizontal row by clicking on the

suit or rank. For example:</p>
<p>10   Q   3   5   A   3 
Since the 3  and the 3  are of the same
rank, the 5  and the A  are eliminated, leaving 4 cards:</p>

All the Hearts between the 10  and 7  can be eliminated, leaving 4 cards:</p>
<p>J   7   10   7 
The 10  would the be alone between the 7  and the 7, so the 10  could be eliminated, leaving 3 cards:</p>

row.</p>
<p>foundation
cards dealt in wrong rows may be interchanged if the exchange
results in the cards moving to the correct row. To interchange
two cards - drag and drop one card on the other, or right click
on one of the cards. For example: there is a 3 in the &quot;2&quot; row
and there is a 2 in the &quot;3&quot; row. Right click on either card and
they will exchange places.</p>
<p>All
the seven cards to the right of each first
foundation
pile (21 cards in all) are available for play.</p>
<p>Aces are dead cards and may be discarded at any time.</p>
<p>If
there is a space in a foundation
row, it is not necessary to fill in that space before dealing the
cards to the
reserve column.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong> (a row of 8 cards below the
foundations)</p>
<p>The
top cards are always available for play to the
foundations
or (if the top card is a two, three or four) to replace cards
moved from the
foundations.</p>
<p>Discard Aces from the reserve right after each deal.</p>
<p>Spaces are automatically filled from the
stock.</p>
<p>Whenever play comes to a standstill, click once on the
stock to
deal eight cards to the

During the deal, if anyone of the reserve cards should be a King, it is placed at the bottom of the stock and substituted with another card from the stock.</p>
<p><strong>Foundations</strong>  (One pile at the top)</p>
<p>There is only one foundation dealt face up from the beginning.</p>

cards onto the foundation
regardless of suit, doubling the value of the card that has just
been played. If the double of a card exceeds 12, the
excess of the double over 13 denotes the card required.</p>
<p>Example. If the foundation
card is a 6, you can play a 12(Queen) on it. The double of 12 (Queen) is 24. This
is 11 more than 13 and the next required card must be a 11 (Jack).
The sequence is the following:
2 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 6 - Queen (12) - Jack (11) - 9 - 5 - 10 - 7 - A

<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong></p>
<p>Deal cards, one at a time, by clicking on the stock.</p>
<p>Discard any combination (doublets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.) of adjacent cards totaling 7 or a multiple of 7 (14, 21, 28, 35, etc.). Discard Sevens singularly.</p>

<p>Note about the number 7:</p>
<p>In a suite of 13 cards the total number of
rank values amounts to 91. This divided by 7, gives the number of cards in the
suite (13). In an entire deck the number of

<p><strong>Object of the game</strong>:
To reorganize the cards by turning them face up in the right piles (so
that all the aces are in the first pile, the deuces in the second, and
so on) before the fourth King appears.Solitaire Rules</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> (12 piles of 4 cards each
numbered from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;12&quot;)</p>
<p>At the
start of the game, the top card of the
reserve pile
(13) is turned up and the journeys of the different cards commence.
Place this card on top of the pile which corresponds to its rank or number. For example, an Ace would be placed on top of
the pile numbered one (1), a 9 on top of the pile numbered nine (9) and
so on.</p>
<p>Jacks
count as 11, Queens 12, and all the other cards according to their face
value.</p>
<p>As there
must never be more than four cards in one pile, the bottom card of the
pile where a card has just been placed automatically turns up and
becomes a &quot;Traveller&quot;. To continue playing, place it on top of the pile
of its own rank
or number.</p>
<p>Keep
repeating this process until a King appears. In this game there is no
room for Kings, so discard the King to the reserve pile (13) and continue with the next &quot;Traveller&quot; card
from the reserve
pile (13).</p>
<p>When the
fourth card of any group is turned up, and there is no face down card to
turn over, the top card of the next higher pile is automatically turned
up.</p>
<p>The game
is lost if the reserve
pile (13) is used up, or the fourth King appears before all the other
face down cards have been turned up, or trasmuted into four-of-a-kind.
This is because the &quot;Travellers&quot; have been used up and there is no other
card in their pile to continue the game. The game can only be won if the
last card to be turned up is the fourth King.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong> (1 extra pile of 4 cards numbered &quot;13&quot;: the &quot;Travellers&quot;)</p>

<p><strong>Object of the game</strong>:
To move all the 2s, 3s and 4s into the top, middle and lower
foundation rows and build these in suit by threes.</p>
<p><strong>Solitaire Rules</strong></p>
<p>A 2,
a 3, and a 4 are placed in the first
column of each
foundation row.</p>
<p>Seven more cards are dealt to the right of the first card to complete the
row.</p>
<p><strong>Foundations</strong>  (24
piles in 3
rows of 8 cards each: complete these
piles to win the
game)</p>
<p>Build the
Two foundations
up in
alternating colors by threes
from 2,
5,  8 to  J (for example, a 5
can be played on an 2).</p>
<p>Build the

can be played on a 3).</p>
<p>Build the
Four foundations
up in
alternating colors by threes
from 4,
7,  10 to  K (for example, a 7
can be played on a 4).</p>
<p>The
remaining 2s, 3s, 4s must be placed in the correct
foundation row according to the card in the first
column of the
row.</p>
<p>No
pile can be built up until it is in its proper
foundation row.</p>
<p>Foundation
cards dealt in wrong rows may be interchanged if the exchange
results in the cards moving to the correct row. To interchange
two cards - drag and drop one card on the other, or right click
on one of the cards. For example: there is a 3 in the &quot;2&quot; row
and there is a 2 in the &quot;3&quot; row. Right click on either card and
they will exchange places.</p>
<p>All
the seven cards to the right of each first
foundation
pile (21 cards in all) are available for play, but no card may
be moved unless the space can be filled by a two, three or four.</p>
<p>Aces
are dead cards, and are discarded as soon as a legal card is
available to replace it.</p>
<p>Cards to fill the spaces may come from the
reserve or another
foundation
row so long as there is an available
reserve card to fill the space in the other row.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong> (a
row of 8 cards below the foundations)</p>
<p>The top
cards are always available for play to the foundations
or (is such top card is a two, three or four) to replace cards
moved from the foundations.</p>
<p>Discard Aces from the reserve directly after each deal.</p>
<p>Spaces are not filled except by the next deal of eight cards.</p>
<p>Whenever play comes to a standstill, deal another row of right
cards upon the
reserve
piles (a total of ten deals).</p>
