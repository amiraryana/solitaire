# Mexican Train Dominoes Game Rules

Mexican Train Dominoes is played in multiple rounds with aim to score lowest at the end of all rounds to win.

Each player gets five tiles at the beginning of each round.

Each round starts with a lead double. In a game played with double-six dominoes set, first round starts with [6-6]. Subsequent rounds start with next lower double([5-5], [4-4], and so on).

At the beginning of a round, lead double is taken out and placed at the center. Each player then receives 5 tiles from the remaining tiles.
The player receiving highest tile starts the round.

Each player has a personal train on which they can play tiles. One additional train (called Mexican train) is also available for all players to play.

In the first turn player can match as many tiles as possible starting with the tile matching lead double for that round.

In subsequent rounds player can only play one tile if it is non-double. Player must play one additional tile if he/she played a double.

Whenever a double is played, it must be closed at the open end with a matching tile. The player who played the double is allowed to play additional tile to any other train (open to player for play) but subsequent players must play a tile on the double first if it was not closed.

If a player can not make a move, he/she draws one tile from the boneyard. if tile can be played, then it must be played, else turn is passed to the next player.

If player can not play a tile, his train is marked as open and becomes available to play by any other player.

Player's personal train which was marked open can only be unmarked if the player again plays a tile to his/her personal train. After it is unmarked, it again becomes unavailable for play to other players.

In the first turn player is not required to play additional tile at the end of a double.

If player can play all tiles in the first round itself, other players get to finish their first turn.

Once a round ends (one player dominoes or game is blocked), each player scores total of pips count in his/her individual hand.

After the end of last round (for lead [0-0]), the player with the lowest score wins.
