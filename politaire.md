# Klondike Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Klondike Solitaire</span><a href="/klondike" target="mainwin">Play Klondike</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
Klondike was probably the best known version of solitaire world-wide. For many people, Klondike, with its triangular tableau and alternating colors, is the canonical game of solitaire. It dates back to at least 1912 when it was included in the Mary Whitmore Jones collection with the name "Small Triangle". Microsoft has added to it's popularity by including a version of Klondike called "Windows Solitaire" in every version of it's operating system since Windows 3.0.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">J♦</span> would be a <span class="redcard">Q♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Seven</b> tableau piles with one card in the first pile, two cards in the second, three in the third, and so on. The top card in each pile is dealt face up, all others are face down.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="redcard">4♦</span> would be <span class="blackcard">3♠</span> or <span class="blackcard">3♣</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>kings only</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if the cards are alternately red and black</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>three cards</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Unlimited passes</b> through the stock are permitted. At the end of any pass where there are not enough cards left in the deck just the remaining cards are dealt. The waste will be flipped over to become a new stock before the next deal.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Klondike is played with many different variations on how cards are dealt from the stock to the waste. Popular variations include:<ul><li>turning over three cards at a time with unlimited passes through the stock.</li><li>turning over three cards at a time allowing only three passes through the stock.</li><li>turning over one card at a time and allowing only one pass through the stock.</li><li>turning over one card at a time with unlimited passes through the stock.</li></ul></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Approximately 79% of Klondike games are possible to win, but with limited information, the likely win rate is more like 43%.<p>Many studies of the solvability of Klondike actually study the game known as <a href="/help/thoughtful">Thoughtful</a> under the mistaken assumption that they are equally difficult. They aren't. Our rules page shows that It is not hard to construct deals that are winnable in Thoughtful but not in Klondike.</p></blockquote>

# Canfield Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Canfield Solitaire</span><a href="/canfield" target="mainwin">Play Canfield</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
Legend says Canfield was devised during the 1890's by Richard Canfield, the owner of a luxurious casino in Saratoga Springs, New York. Players would buy a deck for $50 and earn $5 for every card they were able to play to the foundation.<p>This story has been questioned because, although the game is difficult to win, it isn't so difficult that a skillful player wouldn't have been able to bankrupt Mr. Canfield. Some people believe that the game played in Canfield's casino was the one now best known as <a href="/help/klondike">Klondike</a>.</p><p>In any case, you may want to count yourself a winner if you can take more than ten cards off.</p><p>This game is called "Demon" in England.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck<p>The rank of the lowest and highest card will be determined by the first card played into the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>A random card will be dealt to a foundation pile. This is the base card.  Start the remaining piles with cards of same rank. </p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">6♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">7♥</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one reserve</b>, initially containing <b>thirteen cards</b>.  The top card in the pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. It is not possible to move any cards into the reserve. The top card of the reserve can be played to the tableau or the foundation. </blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="blackcard">9♣</span> would be <span class="redcard">8♥</span> or <span class="redcard">8♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with a card from the reserve. If the reserve is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if the cards are alternately red and black</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>three cards</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Unlimited passes</b> through the stock are permitted. At the end of any pass where there are not enough cards left in the deck just the remaining cards are dealt. The waste will be flipped over to become a new stock before the next deal.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>If you are really serious about winning, you should turn automoves off, at least automoves from the waste. One of the keys to success is managing the stock and waste so you can get access to the cards you need when you need them. That may involve delaying moving cards from the waste to the foundation until the right moment. Doing this requires a lot of planning.</blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>As in Klondike, there is a lot of variation in how cards are dealt from the stock to the waste. Sometimes cards are dealt one at a time instead of three at a time, which makes the game easier. Sometimes the player is limited to a one or two passes through the stock instead of unlimited passes, which makes the game more difficult.</blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran a solver on the first 5000 Politaire Canfield seeds, and was able to find solutions for 71% of them, taking off an average of 39.9 cards per hand. Thus, a perfect player would have won an average of $149 per game from Mr. Canfield. I doubt, however, if any human player could approach that win rate without the use of the "undo" button, which surely would not have been allowed at Mr. Canfield's tables.</blockquote>

# FreeCell Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for FreeCell Solitaire</span><a href="/freecell" target="mainwin">Play FreeCell</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
FreeCell is among the most popular solitaire games. The vast majority of games are possible to win, but most still require some cleverness and a few are very difficult, so it remains pleasantly challenging. Since no cards start face down, no guessing is involved, allowing for very logical play.<p>Very similar games have been around for years, but FreeCell in its modern form was invented by Paul Alfille, who wrote the first computer version in 1978. It's popularity mostly rests on the versions by Jim Horne which have been distributed by Microsoft since 1992.</p><p>Microsoft's game numbers have become the standard for identifying FreeCell deals, so Web Solitaire can recognize them. See the "Usage" page for more information.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">9♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">10♥</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Cells:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> cells, all initially empty<p>Each cell can hold one card. Available cards  can be played into any cell. Cards from cells can be played back to the tableau or to the foundation.</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of cards, with the first four having <b>seven cards</b> each, and the next four having <b>six cards</b> each. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="redcard">J♦</span> would be <span class="blackcard">10♠</span> or <span class="blackcard">10♣</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, an empty cell or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but since supermoves are enabled politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty cells or tableau columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>

# Spider Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Spider Solitaire</span><a href="/spider" target="mainwin">Play Spider</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
On the 10 tableau piles you can build down regardless of suit, but you can only move single suit sequences. When you click on the stock, one card will be dealt to each tableau pile. Single cards cannot be moved to the foundation, only complete sequences.<p>This is another game made famous by Microsoft, though it was a favorite of computer geeks long before that and dates back at least to 1949.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Sort all cards on the tableau <b>downwards in the same suit</b> or move them to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>Single cards may never be moved to the foundation. Only when you have constructed a <b>complete sequence</b> on the tableau, thirteen cards in sequence from ace to king, may you move it to the foundation.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Ten</b> tableau piles of cards, arranged as below, where "<tt>D</tt>" indicates a face-down card and "<tt>U</tt>" indicates a face-up card:<pre>  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

</pre><p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the card that could be played on a queen would be a jack of any suit.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if all cards are of the same suit</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, a card will be dealt on top of each tableau pile. The tableau piles must be filled before you can deal cards.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>If you turn off the option that requires all tableau spaces to be filled before dealing more cards, then you are playing a common variant called "Relaxed Spider."<p>Some versions don't allow you to move any sequences to the foundation, so you must build them all on the tableau. It's always fun to try to win the game while removing as few sequences as possible, and sometimes it's actually useful to have some unremoved sequences still on the tableau.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Alex Robinson has written a solver that was able to win 31,981 games out of 32,000 tried. This is a 99.941% win rate. He estimates that only one game in 3000 is actually unsolvable. I'm fairly certain that this is for the version of the game where individual sorted stacks may be moved to the foundation before the game is done. Of course, this is only achievable in real life with an exceptional amount of undoing.</blockquote>

# Forty and Eight Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Forty and Eight Solitaire</span><a href="/fortyandeight" target="mainwin">Play Forty and Eight</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
Two decks, forty cards in the tableau, eight foundation piles, building down in the same suit. You can only move single cards. Often it feels like nothing is happening for a long time, and then the game works out after all. A good game for making you feel smart.<p>The original version of the program that eventually became Politaire was called "Forty and Eight" and played only this game. So if you are wondering why I choose it as a "core game" rather than the similar but better known "Forty Thieves," now you know. In a purely personal sense, every Politaire game is a variant of Forty and Eight.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks.

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">7♠</span> would be an <span class="blackcard">8♠</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of <b>five</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="greencard">J♣</span> would be a <span class="greencard">10♣</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>

<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Two passes</b> through the stock are permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Many sources say that only one pass through the stock is allowed. That makes the game much more difficult and much less fun (yeah, that's my personal opinion).</blockquote>
<h3>Similar Games:</h3><blockquote><dl><p></p><dt><b>Forty Thieves</b> (<a href="/fortythieves" target="mainwin">Play</a>) (<a href="/help/fortythieves">Rules</a>)

# Accordion Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Accordion Solitaire</span><a href="/accordion" target="mainwin">Play Accordion</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
This deck compression game was once known as "Idle Year" because it was believed that you could play for a year without winning, but players have now discovered strategies that make it possible to win almost every game.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since suits don't matter, politaire substitutes a suitless deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Collapse the deck down to one stack..</blockquote>
<h3>Waste:</h3><blockquote>The entire deck forms <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
</p><p>A card on the waste may be moved on top of another card on the waste if:</p><ol><li>the cards have either the <b>same suit</b> or the <b>same rank</b>, and</li><li>the covered card was <b>one or three cards left</b> of the moved card.</li></ol><p>Once one card covers another, the stack is treated as a single card for all purposes.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>In traditional Accordion, there is a stock from which you deal cards one-by-one to the waste, and you can shift cards in the waste as you go. That way the waste expands and contracts as you play, giving the game it's name. You can play that version by going to the "Structure" tab of the "Option" menu and selecting "yes" for "Have a Stock Pile?".<p>You can also select different leap values to play with, rather than the default values of one and three. Experiments have shown that most combinations of one and a number up to seven are still usually winnable.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Contrary to first impressions, almost all Accordion deals are winnable. Mark Masten wrote a program to solve the game and played some 800,000 random games without finding one that couldn't be solved, and human players can learn to play well enough to do nearly that well. Even if you select one card at random (except the first two) that must be the top card of the last stack, nearly all deals are solvable.</blockquote>

# Miss Milligan Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Miss Milligan Solitaire</span><a href="/missmilligan" target="mainwin">Play Miss Milligan</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A popular English game featuring a tableau that starts with just one card in each column where you have the option to "waive" stacks of cards off into a pocket after the stock runs out.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on an <span class="blackcard">8♣</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">9♣</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Cards may be moved back off of the foundation..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="blackcard">5♠</span> would be <span class="redcard">4♥</span> or <span class="redcard">4♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>kings only</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if the cards are alternately red and black</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, a card will be dealt on top of each tableau pile.</p><p>
When the deck is exhausted, a <b>pocket</b> will appear. A single card or stack of cards can be temporarily stored in this pocket. This is called "waiving". If there is a stack of cards in the pocket then you can not take cards out individually. Only the complete sequence can be removed.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>Miss Milligan games tend to have two stages. While you are dealing cards, you are mostly just trying to do damage control and get a few low cards off. The real battle begins after the stock runs out and you try to use the pocket to get everything off.</blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Many versions allow only one card to be placed in the undefined. You can increase the difficulty by setting that option if you prefer.<p>In some versions ("Mrs Milligan") the undefined is available throughout the game. We don't have a setting for that yet, but you could simulate the one-card version by simply adding a cell.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Remove pairs of cards that <b>add to thirteen</b>. <b>Kings can be removed singly</b>.

<h3>Pyramid:</h3><blockquote>The pyramid contains <b>twenty-eight</b> cards. First, one card is dealt. Then, two cards are dealt in a second row overlapping the previous row.

# Flower Garden Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Flower Garden Solitaire</span><a href="/flowergarden" target="mainwin">Play Flower Garden</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
The six stacks of six cards in the tableau are called "flower beds". You can build down on them in any suit.  Instead of stock and waste piles, you have a bouquet of 16 cards, any of which can be played at any time.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">9♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">10♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Flower Beds:</h3><blockquote><b>Six</b> flower beds piles of <b>six</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a flower beds pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the card that could be played on a seven would be a six of any suit.</p><p>Cards on the flower beds that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other flower beds pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the flower beds may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but if you enable supermoves politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty flower beds columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bouquet:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form <b>one bouquet pile</b>.<p>
</p><p>
<b>All cards</b> in the bouquet are available for play to the flower beds or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>BVS Solitaire uses the name "Flower Garden" for the version in which stacks may be moved, here called "Wildflower". It calls this game "Bouquet." All other sources I've seen indicate that stack moves are not allowed in "Flower Garden."</blockquote>

# Cruel Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Cruel Solitaire</span><a href="/cruel" target="mainwin">Play Cruel</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A game where you can redeal the tableau as often as you like, so long as you can take off at least one card between deals.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>An ace is initially dealt to each foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">6♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">7♥</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Twelve</b> tableau piles of <b>four</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">4♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">3♠</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any non-empty tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may <b>not be filled</b>.</p><p>
Only one card may moved at a time, never sequences.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Redeals:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau an unlimited number of times.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. The cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in top to bottom order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up, and dealing the cards in the same order as they were picked up. </p></blockquote><h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>The anonymous author of the Wikipedia page is quite adamant that the redeal algorithm used in our default configuration is the one and only correct way to play. But many sites, such as Solitaire Till Dawn, use a different method. With either redeal method, you will get the same tableau back if you redeal when no cards have been moved since the last deal, but the results when cards have been moved are quite different.<p>For example, suppose before the redeal, the first pile contains, from top to bottom, cards A-B-C and the second pile contains cards W-X-Y-Z. (Remember - the "top" card is the one you can play - which is confusingly on the bottom on your screen.) With our default redeal algorithm, the first pile will become A-B-C-W, with the top card unchanged and the top card from the next stack tucked under the other three. With the other redeal algorithm, the first pile will be Z-A-B-C, with the original three cards now underneath the card that was previously on the bottom of the second pile. The latter behavior is a bit more intuitive, but it apparently makes the game more difficult to win.</p><p>Of course, Politaire lets you play with the either redeal algorithm. Go to the "Special" tab of the Politaire option panel, and set both the pickup order and the deal order to"columns, L to R, B to T" to get the other behavior.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>The Wikipedia says typical players will be able to win 33% to 40% of games. The alternate dealing algorithm reduces the odds to about half that. Dan Fletcher says a careful player can win about half of all games.<p>I wrote a solver that was able to solve 74.5% out of a million games when it was restricted to redealing only when no other moves could be made. More games are solvable if you don't have that restriction, but the exact percentage is still unknown. It is at least 87% and no more than 98%.</p><p>With the alternate dealing method, only 46.7% of games are solvable if you redeal only when stuck.</p></blockquote>

# Tournament Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Tournament Solitaire</span><a href="/tournament" target="mainwin">Play Tournament</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A two-deck game where no building is allowed on the tableau, and you must rely on eight cells to move your cards to the foundation.<p>Thomas Warfield says Tournament was "invented from the games La Nivernaise and Marechal Saxe by Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith."</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There are <b>two</b> groups of foundation piles.<p>
<em>Ace Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The ace foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the ace foundation. Each pile must start with a different suit.</p><p>A card may be added onto a ace foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">4♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">5♦</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p></blockquote><p><em>King Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The king foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any king may be moved to any empty pile in the king foundation. Each pile must start with a different suit.</p><p>A card may be added onto a king foundation pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">4♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">3♠</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p></blockquote><p>Cards may be moved back off of any foundation..</p></blockquote><h3>Cells:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> cells, each of which initially contains one card At least one of the initial cards must be an ace or king.<p>Each cell can hold one card. Available cards  from the tableau can be played into any cell. Cards from cells can be played back to the tableau or to the foundation.</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Six</b> tableau piles of <b>four</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p><b>No building</b> is permitted on the tableau</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or an empty cell.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with four cards from the stock. If the stock is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may <b>not be filled</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but if you enable supermoves politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty cells so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, four cards will be dealt on top of each tableau pile.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Redeals:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau 2 times. Redeals may be performed whenever the stock is empty.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. The cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in bottom to top order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up. First, deal the tableau in the same arrangement as it was originally dealt, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, dealing the cards in each column in left to right order.  Any remaining cards form the new stock. </p></blockquote><h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>It's all about the cells. Try to keep some empty ones around, and if you fill them, try to fill them with things you have a hope of getting back out again soon. Sometimes putting sequential cards into the cells is good.</blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>There is an older variation called "La Nivernaise" or "Napoleon's Flank" which seems to differ only in that the tableau piles are not splayed.<p>According to the Wikipedia, you are supposed to keep redealing until you get a deal with at least one ace or king in a cell. When Politaire encounters such a deal, it instead extracts a random king or ace from the deck and replaces the card in one cell with it. This means that the odds of having only one ace or king in the initial deal are higher with Politaire than with a standard implementation, making the game a smidgeon harder.</p><p>Pretty Good Solitaire's version starts with four cards already in the foundation and does not eliminate games with no playable cards in the cells.</p><p>Most implementations refer to the cells as the "reserve". Wikipedia suggests the cells should be called "kibitzers" and the tableau "dormitzers". I've defaulted to calling a cell a cell.</p></blockquote>

# Penguin Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Penguin Solitaire</span><a href="/penguin" target="mainwin">Play Penguin</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A satisfying game with seven cells developed by David Parlett where one of the cards you need to start the foundation is always buried at the bottom of the first tableau pile.<p>Politaire's automatically generated description of the deal is a bit weird. If you actually have a deck of cards in your hands, what you should do is start by dealing the seven-by-seven tableau. Note the first card dealt to the first tableau stack. When the other three cards of the same rank appear, deal them to the foundation instead of the tableau.</p><p>The first card on the tableau is called the "beak". The cells are called the "flipper". These names make the whole tableau look like a cute little penguin. Well, no, not really. Parlett invented it for his "Penguin Book of Patience".</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards.<p>The rank of the lowest and highest card will be determined by the first card played into the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>A random card will be dealt to a foundation pile. This is the base card. Other cards of the same value are dealt to the next two piles.

<h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>I'm a little puzzled by this game. I find it easiest to play by defering removal of cards until I've got the suits mostly sorted on the tableau, and then removing them one suit at a time, first all the hearts and then the others. If you actually remove the suits in mixed-up order while playing, you tend to get left-over cards that you can't build on or with. But Warfield's own implementation automoves cards to the foundation very aggressively, which I think makes the game almost unplayable. Maybe I'm missing something.</blockquote>

<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Nearly all descriptions of the game say that no cards may be moved into empty tableau columns. Played that way, the game is pretty much impossible to win. If you want to try beating your head against that wall, you can set it on the "Tableau" tab of the options.<p>In many versions the cards are dealt face down.</p><p>The article by Michael Smoker below seems to suggest that you can turn a single card up from the stock and if it fits a column, you can place it there.

I assume he is also allowing cards to be moved to empty columns.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran some tests with a solver and found that only about one game in 20,000 is solvable if you play the traditional way, where spaces may not be filled from the tableau.

# Ali Baba Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Ali Baba Solitaire</span><a href="/alibaba" target="mainwin">Play Ali Baba</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A one-deck variation of <a href="/help/fortyandeight">Forty and Eight</a> where you can move sequences of cards together instead of just one at a time. With 40 cards in the tableau, you only have 12 cards in your deck which makes for a lot of unsolvable games. But with a bit of luck you can open an empty space in your tableau and then things are likely to go smoothly.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">4♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">5♠</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Ten</b> tableau piles of <b>four</b> cards each, splayed downward.

Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if all cards are of the same suit</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Only one pass</b> through the stock is permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>In the early parts of the game there isn't much you can do except play every card that is playable. With some luck, you'll open up an empty tableau space. At that point you start having some choices to make, because there are many cards that could be moved into that space. It's usually not very hard to find a path to victory from that point, but it does require a bit of thought.</blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>We default to not allowing redeals, though some sources say there should be unlimited redeals. Some sources start with the aces already dealt to the foundation and call the variation where that is not done "Big Forty."</blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran a solver on the first million Politaire.com seeds and found that 39.7% were solvable. If you allow unlimited passes, 43.3% are solvable. If you start with Aces pre-dealt to the foundation, 45.0% are solvable. If you do do both, 45.3% are solvable.<p>If you are playing with real cards, and not shuffling entirely thoroughly, then the game gets much easier so long as you deal the tableau by rows. If you deal it by columns, having a less than completely shuffled deck makes the game slightly harder instead.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
This relative of <a href="/help/cloverleaf">Clover Leaf</a> does not allow spaces to be filled, but allows one redeal.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There are <b>two</b> groups of foundation piles.<p>
<em>Red Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The red foundation contains <b>two</b> piles.
<p>An red ace is initially dealt to each red foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a red foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">10♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">J♠</span>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Black Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The black foundation contains <b>two</b> piles.

All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than or <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="blackcard">J♠</span> would be <span class="blackcard">10♠</span> or <span class="blackcard">Q♠</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any non-empty tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may <b>not be filled</b>.</p><p>
Only one card may moved at a time, never sequences.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Redeal:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau 1 time.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. After being picked up, the cards are shuffled thoroughly and are then dealt out again. Deal the tableau in the same arrangement as it was originally dealt, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, dealing the cards in each column in left to right order. </p></blockquote><h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>Since spaces cannot be filled, it can be hard to reverse stacks that get built in the wrong direction, so careful planning is needed. The redeal gives you a last saving throw, but because there are typically few stacks, if you don't get lucky with the order of the cards, it often proves useless.</blockquote>

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>A random card will be dealt to a foundation pile. This is the base card.  Start the remaining piles with cards of same rank. </p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">7♣</span> would be an <span class="blackcard">8♣</span>.

# Antares Solitaire

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
In this weird game the tableau is split into two parts. <a href="/help/freecell">FreeCell</a> rules apply to the left four columns, and <a href="/help/scorpion">Scorpion</a> rules apply to the right four columns. Sequences can be moved from side to side, so long as they are legal sequences to move from the originating side and the top card fits according to the rules of the destination side.<p>This is a Thomas Warfield invention.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on an <span class="blackcard">8♣</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">9♣</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Cells:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> cells, all initially empty<p>Each cell can hold one card. Available cards  can be played into any cell. Cards from cells can be played back to the tableau or to the foundation.</p></blockquote><h3>Left Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> left tableau piles of <b>seven</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a left tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="blackcard">7♠</span> would be <span class="redcard">6♥</span> or <span class="redcard">6♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the left tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, an empty cell, any other left tableau pile or any right tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the left tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but since supermoves are enabled politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty cells or left tableau columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Right Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> right tableau piles of <b>six</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a right tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">Q♦</span> would be a <span class="redcard">J♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the right tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, an empty cell, any left tableau pile or any other right tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the right tableau may be filled by <b>kings only</b>.</p><p>
Furthermore, any face-up card anywhere in the right tableau may be moved to another right tableau column where it fits, taking all cards that were on top of it along.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Warfield places the FreeCell columns on the right and the Scorpion columns on the left. I reversed this because I think it makes more sense for the FreeCell columns to be under the cells.<p>My implementation of supermoves is the same as Warfield's, in that it allows you to move stacks of alternating colors from the FreeCell side to the Scorpions side, but this actually makes no sense, because you could not do the same thing as a sequence of single moves. I think this is icky, but it would probably ruin the game if fixed.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
An old solitaire game in which no building is allowed on the tableau. The secret to winning is to get extremely lucky before you abandon the game out of shear boredom or to play a more skill-dependent variation like <a href="/help/sirtommy">Sir Tommy</a> instead.<p>Automoves are turned off for this game to give the player something to do.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> foundation pile.

<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>The version of the game where you don't start with the Aces on the foundation is called "Tam O'Shanter". It is substantially more difficult. I suppose could include that in our list of standard games, but how much futility does anyone really need?</blockquote>

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A <a href="/help/fan">Fan</a> variation where you can build up and down in suit, but are limited to three cards per pile.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.

<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>A random card will be dealt to a foundation pile. This is the base card.  Start the remaining piles with cards of same rank. </p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">4♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">5♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Fifteen</b> tableau piles of <b>three</b> cards each, splayed downward.

<h3>Hole:</h3><blockquote><b>Three</b> hole piles of <b>two</b> cards each, splayed downward.

Empty spaces in the hole may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but if you enable supermoves politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty hole columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Thirteen</b> foundation piles.
<p>There is one foundation pile for each rank from ace to king. Completed groups of four cards of equal rank  may be played to the appropriate pile.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off.</p></blockquote>.<h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one reserve</b>, initially containing <b>ten cards</b>.  The top card in the pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. It is not possible to move any cards into the reserve. The top card of the reserve can be played only to the tableau. </blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Six</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward.

<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>three cards</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Unlimited passes</b> through the stock are permitted. At the end of any pass where there are not enough cards left in the deck just the remaining cards are dealt. The waste will be flipped over to become a new stock before the next deal.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Some versions start with a reserve of 16 cards. In others empty spaces are automatically filled from the reserve first, and then the waste when the reserve is empty, but the game is more strategic if you have the option of leaving a tableau space empty.</blockquote>

A one-deck variant of <a href="/help/fortythieves">Forty Thieves</a> that allows stack moves. Personally, I think they should have called it "Bad Forty". It only turns into a game of skill if you are lucky enough to be able to open a column, and not much skill is required then.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">6♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">7♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Ten</b> tableau piles of <b>four</b> cards each, splayed downward.

Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if all cards are of the same suit</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Unlimited passes</b> through the stock are permitted.</p><p>

# Block Ten Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Block Ten Solitaire</span><a href="/blockten" target="mainwin">Play Block Ten</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A game of pure luck where you can remove pairs that add to ten, or pairs of face cards, but not tens. Called "Block Ten" because it blocks a lot.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since suits don't matter, politaire substitutes a suitless deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Remove pairs of cards that <b>add to ten</b>. Jacks, queens, and kings can be removed by pairing them with another card of the same rank. <b>Tens cannot be removed</b>. Thus, the list of legal sets that can be removed is:<blockquote>Ace-Nine, Two-Eight, Three-Seven, Four-Six, Five-Five, Jack-Jack, Queen-Queen, or King-King</blockquote><p>You win if you successfully remove all but four cards.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There a single foundation pile where removed cards are stacked.</blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Nine</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each. All cards are dealt face up.<p><b>No building</b> is permitted on the tableau</p><p>Cards on the tableau are available for play.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with a card from the stock. If the stock is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may <b>not be filled</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
Cards cannot be manually removed from the stock.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran a solver on the first million Politaire Block Ten seeds, and found only 3.67% were solvable. This is pretty much exactly the win rate users should expect. In 6.65% of games no cards could be removed at all. On average, six pairs could be removed.</blockquote>

# Captive Queens Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Captive Queens Solitaire</span><a href="/captivequeens" target="mainwin">Play Captive Queens</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
An easy and brainless variation of <a href="/help/sixesandsevens">Sixes and Sevens</a> also known as "Quadrille". Automoves default mostly off to give you something to do.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There are <b>three</b> groups of foundation piles.<p>
<em>Fives Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The fives foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any five may be moved to any empty pile in the fives foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a fives foundation pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">J♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">10♦</span>. Each pile is built down from five to king. No further cards may then be played.</p></blockquote><p><em>Sixes Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The sixes foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any six may be moved to any empty pile in the sixes foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a sixes foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">9♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">10♠</span>. Each pile is built up from six to jack. No further cards may then be played.</p></blockquote><p><em>Queens Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The queens foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any queen may be moved to any empty pile in the queens foundation.</p><p><b>No building</b> is permitted on the queens foundation</p></blockquote><p>Once on any foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The entire deck forms the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Three passes</b> through the stock are permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Some people start with the Queens, Fives and Sixes already dealt to the foundation. Pre-playing the Queens makes no difference, but having the others already off makes the game much easier.</blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran a solver on a million random Captive Queens deals and found that 59% were winnable in three deals. Only three in a thousand were winnable in two deals.<p>If the Fives and Sixes are pre-dealt to the foundation, 97% were winnable in three deals and 12% were winnable in two deals. Even with this easier version, only about two in a million are winnable in a single deal.</p><p>This game is basically a test of how well ordered your deck is, so it turns out to be much easier when played with real cards. If you only shuffle three or four times between hands, enough ordering should survive in the deck to enable you to win almost every time.</p></blockquote>

# Clover Leaf Solitaire

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
An easy game invented by Thomas Warfield where you build up or down on the tableau, two foundation piles build up, and two build down.

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There are <b>two</b> groups of foundation piles.<p>
<em>Red Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The red foundation contains <b>two</b> piles.
<p>An red ace is initially dealt to each red foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a red foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">7♦</span> would be an <span class="redcard">8♦</span>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Black Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The black foundation contains <b>two</b> piles.
<p>A black king is initially dealt to each black foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a black foundation pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">6♦</span> would be a <span class="redcard">5♦</span>.</p></blockquote><p>Once on any foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Fan:</h3><blockquote><b>Sixteen</b> fan piles of <b>three</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a fan pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than or <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="blackcard">6♣</span> would be <span class="blackcard">5♣</span> or <span class="blackcard">7♣</span>.</p><p>Cards on the fan that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other fan pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the fan may be filled by <b>aces or kings only</b>.</p><p>
Only one card may moved at a time, never sequences.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Warfield's choice to call this game "Clover Leaf" may cause some confusion, since that name is used by some for a different game more commonly called "La Belle Lucie".</blockquote>

<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There are <b>two</b> groups of foundation piles.<p>
<em>Aces Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The aces foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the aces foundation.

# Coyote Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Coyote Solitaire</span><a href="/coyote" target="mainwin">Play Coyote</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
An slightly easier, but still difficult, variation of <a href="/help/acme">Acme</a> in which sequences can be moved. Named after Acme's best customer.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>An ace is initially dealt to each foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">Q♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">K♥</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one reserve</b>, initially containing <b>thirteen cards</b>.  The top card in the pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. It is not possible to move any cards into the reserve. The top card of the reserve can be played to the tableau or the foundation. </blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">4♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">3♥</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with a card from the reserve. If the reserve is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if all cards are of the same suit</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Two passes</b> through the stock are permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>There isn't much strategy to this game - until the reserve has been emptied, you should just make every move you can. If you are lucky enough to be able to empty the reserve, then you may need to do a little thinking about the best cards to use to fill empty spaces in the tableau.</blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>AisleRiot includes a game called "Straight Up" which is exactly like "Coyote" except that the foundation starts with twos instead of aces.</blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter wrote a solver that found that 19% of the first million Politaire Coyote seeds are solvable. If the game is solvable, then the solution isn't hard to find, so alert players should expect to solve about that percentage of games.</blockquote>

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>

<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on an <span class="blackcard">8♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">9♠</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eighteen</b> tableau piles of cards, with the first sixteen having <b>three cards</b> each, and the next two having <b>two cards</b> each.

<h3>Redeals:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau 6 times.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. The cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in bottom to top order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up. Deal the tableau in the same arrangement as it was originally dealt, one row at a time, starting with the bottom-most row, dealing the cards in each row in left to right order. </p></blockquote><h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>You want to get your kings to the bottoms of stacks. Since cards are picked up by columns and dealt by rows, you acheive this by moving as many cards as possible so they are after your kings in column order, by building them on kings, especially the rightmost king, or on cards to the right of kings.</blockquote>

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
In this game the tableau is split into two parts. <a href="/help/canfield">Canfield</a> rules apply to the left four columns, and <a href="/help/fortythieves">Forty Thieves</a> rules apply to the right five columns. Sequences can be moved from side to side, so long as they are legal sequences to move from the originating side and the top card fits according to the rules of the destination side.<p>This is a Thomas Warfield invention.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks<p>The rank of the lowest and highest card will be determined by the first card played into the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>A random card will be dealt to a foundation pile. This is the base card.  Start the remaining piles with cards of same rank. </p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on an <span class="blackcard">8♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">9♠</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one reserve</b>, initially containing <b>thirteen cards</b>.  The top card in the pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. It is not possible to move any cards into the reserve. The top card of the reserve can be played to the left tableau, the right tableau or the foundation. </blockquote><h3>Left Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> left tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a left tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="redcard">9♥</span> would be <span class="blackcard">8♠</span> or <span class="blackcard">8♣</span>.</p><p>Cards on the left tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, any other left tableau pile or any right tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the left tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one left tableau column to another <b>if the cards are alternately red and black</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Right Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Five</b> right tableau piles of <b>eight</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a right tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">10♦</span> would be a <span class="redcard">9♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the right tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, any left tableau pile or any other right tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the right tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one right tableau column to another <b>if all cards are of the same suit</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Three passes</b> through the stock are permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the left tableau, the right tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>There is a variation called "Demonthief" in which no redeals are allowed.</blockquote>

# Diavolo Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Diavolo Solitaire</span><a href="/diavolo" target="mainwin">Play Diavolo</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A <a href="/help/klondike">Klondike</a> variant with four foundation piles that are built one card at a time, while the other four need completed sequences.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks.

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There are <b>three</b> groups of foundation piles.<p>

# Dieppe Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Dieppe Solitaire</span><a href="/dieppe" target="mainwin">Play Dieppe</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A variation on <a href="/help/congress">Congress</a> where stacks may be moved, blanks can be filled by any card, and three rows of cards are dealt initially. Almost every game seems winnable without any great difficulty.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">5♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">6♠</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of <b>three</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the card that could be played on an eight would be a seven of any suit.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any non-empty tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b> from the waste. They may not be filed from other tableau piles.</p><p>

<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Only one pass</b> through the stock is permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>The only way to move a king that is on the tableau, in this game, is to move it to the foundation. So if kings are dealt on top of enough lower cards of the same suit, then the deal is likely to be unwinnable. Such unwinnable deals are rare, but not so rare that you'll never encunter them. The game is easy enough that you should be able to win most any game that isn't clearly impossible, so win rates around 98% are normal.</blockquote>

# Dnieper Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Dnieper Solitaire</span><a href="/dnieper" target="mainwin">Play Dnieper</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
Exactly like <a href="/help/kiev">Kiev</a> but slightly easier because kings can be played on aces.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Single cards may never be moved to the foundation. Only when you have constructed a <b>complete sequence</b> on the tableau, thirteen cards in sequence from ace to king, may you move it to the foundation.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Seven</b> tableau piles of <b>four</b> cards each, splayed downward. The top card in each pile is dealt face up, all others are face down.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">9♦</span> would be an <span class="bluecard">8♦</span>. You may also play kings on aces in the tableau.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Furthermore, any face-up card anywhere in the tableau may be moved to another tableau column where it fits, taking all cards that were on top of it along.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, a card will be dealt on top of each tableau pile.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran a solver on the first ten-thousand Politaire deals of Dniper and found that 78.2% were solvable. Only 50.7% of Kiev games are solvable, so adding the ability to play kings on aces does make a significant difference. Players who do not do a ton of un-doing and re-doing are more likely to see win rates around 25% though.</blockquote>

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
Easthaven is like Klondike, in that you have to build down in alternate colors and move cards individually to the foundation, but the cards from the stock are dealt onto each tableau pile, as in Spider. The game is quite old, dating back at least to 1931.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.

<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>

<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>My default version is rather easier than the normal version because it allows empty spaces in the tableau to be filled by any card instead of only allowing them to be filled by a king.

# Eight Off Solitaire

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="greencard">Q♣</span> would be a <span class="greencard">K♣</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Cells:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> cells,four of which initially contain one card<p>Each cell can hold one card. Available cards  can be played into any cell. Cards from cells can be played back to the tableau or to the foundation.</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of <b>six</b> cards each, splayed downward.

Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but since supermoves are enabled politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty cells so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>The fact that empty tableau columns can only be filled by kings means that they aren't anywhere near as valuable as they are in freecell. In fact, they are nearly worthless, because they can't be used as staging places to move long sequences of cards. Thus the maximum sequence length you can move depends entirely on the number of free cells, and you need to use very different strategies than in FreeCell.</blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Some implementations of this game allow spaces to be filled with any card instead of with Kings only. This makes the game much easier and much more freecell-like. I think the game is plenty easy when played the "official" way, but if you like your solitaire easier still, feel free to change the rule.</blockquote>

# Ephemeral FreeCell Solitaire

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
In Ephemeral FreeCell, some of the cells vanish after their first use. It was invented by Michael Keller. Our default version has three permanent cells and one ephemeral one, but this is only one of the many variations that has been studied. Feel free to experiment with other variations.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">Q♦</span> would be a <span class="redcard">K♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Cells:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> cells,<b> one ephemeral</b>, all initially empty<p>Each cell can hold one card. Available cards  can be played into any cell. Cards from cells can be played back to the tableau or to the foundation</p><p>Ephemeral cells vanish after one use.</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of cards, with the first four having <b>seven cards</b> each, and the next four having <b>six cards</b> each. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="redcard">5♥</span> would be <span class="blackcard">4♠</span> or <span class="blackcard">4♣</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, an empty cell or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but since supermoves are enabled politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty cells or tableau columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves. Note that ephemeral cells will never be used in supermoves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>With three permanent cells and one ephemeral cells, only eight of the first million Microsoft FreeCell deals turn out to be insolvable, which is twice as many as regular FreeCell, but still not a lot.</blockquote>

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">5♠</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">6♠</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Ten</b> tableau piles of cards, with the first two having <b>six cards</b> each, and the next eight having <b>five cards</b> each. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than or <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="bluecard">5♦</span> would be <span class="bluecard">4♦</span> or <span class="bluecard">6♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>

Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but since supermoves are enabled politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty tableau columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>I ran a solver on the first million Politaire seeds for the game Fortress, and found that about 20% of games are solvable. But for 19% of games it is not even possible to move one card to the foundation, and for another 20%, only one card could be taken off. Paradoxically, this makes it a reasonably pleasant game to play on a computer, since most of the unsolvable deals can be quickly identified and discarded, letting you move on to more interesting deals. However, players who are not computers should expect win rates more in the range of 10% to 15%.</blockquote>

A simple game of luck and skill where you move cards one at a time, stacking regardless of suit. The five tableau piles are supposed to be arranged in a cross with the foundation piles in the four corners, but Politaire is still too stupid to do that.<p>This game is also called "Corner Card" or "Vanishing Cross" because it is supposed to be dealt with the five tableau piles forming a cross with the four foundation piles in the corners.

# Indefatigable Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Indefatigable Solitaire</span><a href="/indefatigable" target="mainwin">Play Indefatigable</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
This variation of <a href="/help/royalfamily">Royal Family</a> is basically the same, but the foundations build up from ace, and it is made even easier by a extra redeal.<p>I presume this is named after Sir Edward Pellew's heavy frigate, famous in fact and fiction, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Indefatigable_(1784)">HMS Indefatigable</a>.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>An ace is initially dealt to each foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">Q♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">K♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Twelve</b> tableau piles of <b>four</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than or <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="redcard">10♥</span> would be <span class="redcard">9♥</span> or <span class="redcard">J♥</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but if you enable supermoves politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty tableau columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Redeals:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau 2 times.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. The cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in bottom to top order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up. Deal the tableau in the same arrangement as it was originally dealt, one row at a time, starting with the bottom-most row, dealing the cards in each row in left to right order. </p></blockquote><h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Sometimes this is played with unlimited redeals, which is a bit mad, since you rarely need any.</blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter wrote a solver for this game and ran it on the first million Politaire seeds, 0 through 999999. It was able to solve all but 23 games, for a 99.998% win rate. Note that a few games can only be won by NOT removing all the cards that can be removed before redealing. Players can reasonably expect to maintain a 100% win rate for a long time, as the difficult games are very, very rare. About 88% of games can be won without even using a redeal.</blockquote>

# Frog Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Frog Solitaire</span><a href="/frog" target="mainwin">Play Frog</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A relation of <a href="/help/sirtommy">Sir Tommy</a> with a reserve.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks. Since suits don't matter, politaire substitutes a suitless deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="undefined">J</span> would be a <span class="undefined">Q</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Frog:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one frog</b>, initially containing <b>thirteen cards</b>.  All cards are dealt face up. It is not possible to move any cards into the frog. The top card of the frog can be played only to the foundation. </blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Five</b> tableau piles, all initially empty.<p>Cards from the stock may be added to the tableau <b>regardless of suit or rank</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="undefined">7</span> would be <span class="undefined">A</span>, <span class="undefined">2</span>, <span class="undefined">3</span>, <span class="undefined">4</span>, <span class="undefined">5</span>, <span class="undefined">6</span>, <span class="undefined">7</span>, <span class="undefined">8</span>, <span class="undefined">9</span>, <span class="undefined">10</span>, <span class="undefined">J</span>, <span class="undefined">Q</span> or <span class="undefined">K</span>. Cards from other tableau piles or the frog may not be moved to the tableau.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b> from the stock. They may not be filed from other tableau piles or the frog.</p><p>
Only one card may moved at a time, never sequences.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
The top card of the stock is always face up so you can drag it at your discretion to the tableau or the foundation. </p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Most sources say that if no aces are moved to the foundation while dealing the frog, then we should find an ace in the deck to put in the first foundation pile. Poliaire doesn't do this because I haven't gotten around to implementing it. Sorry.<p>Pretty Good Solitaire, unlike all other sources, says the foundations should be built in suit, which makes the game much, much harder.</p></blockquote>

# Golf Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Golf Solitaire</span><a href="/golf" target="mainwin">Play Golf</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
Build up or down on the single foundation to take cards off the tableau, where no building is allowed. This game is sometimes called "One Foundation."</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since suits don't matter, politaire substitutes a suitless deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards not in the stockto the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> foundation pile.
<p></p><p>A card may be added onto the foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than or <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="undefined">5</span> would be <span class="undefined">4</span> or <span class="undefined">6</span>.You <b>may not wrap</b> on the foundation so you can not play an ace on a king or a king on an ace.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Seven</b> tableau piles of <b>five</b> cards each, splayed downward.

Only one card may moved at a time, never sequences.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, a card will be dealt on top of the foundation pile.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Strategy:</h3><blockquote>You should start each game by counting the Kings and Aces on the tableau. A King on the tableau can only be removed by playing it on a Queen. If all four Kings are on the tableau, then every one of your Queens must be used to remove a King. You can't afford to play any JQJ sequences. The same goes for Aces and Twos.</blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>More traditional versions of this game don't allow queens (or anything else) to be played on king. Politaire doesn't have an option to enforce that rule, but you are welcome to impose it on yourself if you choose.</blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran a solver on the first 100,000 politaire seeds for Golf and found that about 45% of deals can be won. On average only 1.5 cards could not be removed, so even the unwinnable games typically get very close. If you don't allow queens to be played on kings, then the solvable percentage falls to about 26%.</blockquote>

# Kingdom Solitaire

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A game where no building is allowed in the tableau and suits are ignored while building up the tableau.

Since suits don't matter, politaire substitutes a suitless deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="undefined">9</span> would be a <span class="undefined">10</span>.

<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>

<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>There seems to be some disagreement about how empty tableau spaces should be filled, but nearly everyone agrees that they should be auto-filled, either from the waste or the waste or both. Thomas Warfield calls one variation on this theme "Kingdom" and the other "Dominion." I chose instead to let the player choose to fill spaces from the waste at their pleasure, giving the player a few more choices to make, making the game much easier to win, and leaving the "Dominion" name for a <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion">far better card game</a>. Feel free to modify the rules to fit your preference.</blockquote>

# King Tut Solitaire

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A pyramid variation where we deal three cards at once and have unlimited redeals. This seems to be based on MicroSoft's game "Tut's Tomb".</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since suits don't matter, politaire substitutes a suitless deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Remove all cards in the pyramid. Remove pairs of cards that <b>add to thirteen</b>. <b>Kings can be removed singly</b>. Thus, the list of legal pairs that can be removed is:<blockquote>Ace-Queen, Two-Jack,Three-Ten, Four-Nine, Five-Eight, Six-Seven, or King</blockquote>.</blockquote>
<h3>Pyramid:</h3><blockquote>The pyramid contains <b>twenty-eight</b> cards. First, one card is dealt. Then, two cards are dealt in a second row overlapping the previous row. Then, three cards are dealt in the third row, four cards are dealt in the fourth row, five cards are dealt in the fifth row, six cards are dealt in the sixth row, and finally seven cards are dealt in the seventh row. All cards are dealt face up.<p><b>No building</b> is permitted on the pyramid</p><p>Cards on the pyramid that are not under another card are available for play.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the pyramid may <b>not be filled</b>.</p></blockquote><h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>three cards</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Unlimited passes</b> through the stock are permitted. At the end of any pass where there are not enough cards left in the deck just the remaining cards are dealt. The waste will be flipped over to become a new stock before the next deal.</p><p>

A <a href="/help/fortythieves">Forty Thieves</a> variant with thirteen tableau piles and aces starting on the foundation.<p>There are many slightly different <a href="/help/fortythieves">Forty Thieves</a> variants sometimes called "Lucas".

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>An ace is initially dealt to each foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">10♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">J♥</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Thirteen</b> tableau piles of <b>three</b> cards each, splayed downward.

The version here is a slightly modified version by Thomas Warfield.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="blackcard">10♣</span> would be a <span class="blackcard">J♣</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Ten</b> tableau piles with one card in the first pile, two cards in the second, three in the third, and so on. The top card in each pile is dealt face up, all others are face down.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="blackcard">J♣</span> would be <span class="redcard">10♥</span> or <span class="redcard">10♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with a card from the stock. If the stock is empty, then it is filled with a card from the undefined. If the undefined is empty, then it is filled with a card from the waste. If the waste is empty, then it is filled with a card from the stock. If the stock is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>kings only</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if the cards are alternately red and black</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Only one pass</b> through the stock is permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>

# Neptune Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Neptune Solitaire</span><a href="/neptune" target="mainwin">Play Neptune</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A game where you remove pairs of consecutive cards.<p>Note that it is impossible to remove all cards. There will always be at least four left behind. You win if you get it down to just four.</p><p>Since suits don't matter in this game, and in honor of the name of the game, politaire uses a deck of green trident cards. You could, of course, play with a standard deck.</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> decks each containing only <b>one suit</b> of tridents.</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Remove pairs of cards that are <b>in sequence</b>. Thus the list of legal pairs that can be removed is:<blockquote>Ace-Two, Two-Three, Three-Four, Four-Five, Five-Six, Six-Seven, Seven-Eight, Eight-Nine, Nine-Ten, Ten-Jack, Jack-Queen, or Queen-King.</blockquote>Aces cannot be removed with Kings.<p>You win if you successfully remove all but four cards.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There a single foundation pile where removed cards are stacked.</blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each. All cards are dealt face up.<p><b>No building</b> is permitted on the tableau</p><p>Cards on the tableau are available for play.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with a card from the stock. If the stock is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may <b>not be filled</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock.<p>
Cards cannot be manually removed from the stock.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>The victory condition used here is a wee bit tougher than usual. Normally, it is counted as a win if you empty the stock. But the game is easy enough that I think it is more fun to require that all but four cards be removed.</blockquote>

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
Another <a href="/help/busyaces">Busy Aces</a> variation by Thomas Warfield, in this one, half the tabeau builds up, and half builds down.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Two</b> standard decks. Since suits don't matter, politaire substitutes a suitless deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote>There are <b>two</b> groups of foundation piles.<p>
<em>Left Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The left foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any five may be moved to any empty pile in the left foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a left foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="undefined">J</span> would be a <span class="undefined">Q</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Cards may be moved back off of the left foundation.</p></blockquote><p><em>Right Foundation:</em></p><blockquote>The right foundation contains <b>four</b> piles.
<p>Any five may be moved to any empty pile in the right foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a right foundation pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="undefined">3</span> would be a <span class="undefined">2</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the right foundation, cards may not be moved back off.</p></blockquote>.</blockquote><h3>Left Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Three</b> left tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a left tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="undefined">5</span> would be a <span class="undefined">4</span>. You may also play kings on aces in the left tableau.</p><p>Cards on the left tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, any other left tableau pile or any right tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the left tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Technically, only one card may be moved at a time, but if you enable supermoves politaire will allow you to move sequences when there are enough empty left tableau columns so that it would be possible to achieve the same end by  a sequence of single card moves.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Right Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Three</b> right tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward.

<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Only one pass</b> through the stock is permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the left tableau, the right tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>

# Perseverance A Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Perseverance A Solitaire</span><a href="/perseverancea" target="mainwin">Play Perseverance A</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A variation of <a href="/help/cruel">Cruel</a> where stacks may be moved.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>An ace is initially dealt to each foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">4♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">5♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Twelve</b> tableau piles of <b>four</b> cards each, splayed downward.

Empty spaces in the tableau may <b>not be filled</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if all cards are of the same suit</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Redeals:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau an unlimited number of times.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. The cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in bottom to top order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up, and dealing the cards in the same order as they were picked up. </p></blockquote><h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>There seems to be more disagreement than usual about the rules of perseverance. The version I call "Perseverance A" is the most common. Many descriptions say that only two redeals should be allowed, but because the redeal algorithm does very little to change the arrangement of the cards, I think it plays better with unlimited redeals, and this is done by many other computer implementations that I have seen.<p>The 1898 description linked to below actually sounds more like <a href="/help/cruel">Cruel</a> than the modern game of Persistence.</p><p>The redeal algorithm used here is exactly the one that is generally considered the "wrong" redeal method for <a href="/help/cruel">Cruel</a>. I suspect that the cruel redeal algorithm would work well for Perseverance.</p></blockquote>

The version I call "Perseverance B" is based the version at Pretty Good Solitaire. Unlike <a href="/help/perseverancea">Perseverance A</a>, it uses a redeal algorithm similar to the <a href="/help/indefatigable">Indefatigable</a> redeal algorithm that massively disrupts the order of the layout, so it makes sense to set a limit of two redeals. In fact, the BVS Solitaire version allows no redeals at all, and the game is often winnable without a redeal.</blockquote>

# Rainbow Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Rainbow Solitaire</span><a href="/rainbow" target="mainwin">Play Rainbow</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A variation of <a href="/help/canfield">Canfield</a> in which you can build regardless of suit.<p>This is sometimes called "Rainbow Canfield" to distinguish it from "<a href="/help/rainbowfan">Rainbow Fan</a>".</p></blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards.<p>The rank of the lowest and highest card will be determined by the first card played into the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>A random card will be dealt to a foundation pile. This is the base card.  Start the remaining piles with cards of same rank. </p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">7♦</span> would be an <span class="bluecard">8♦</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one reserve</b>, initially containing <b>thirteen cards</b>.  The top card in the pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. It is not possible to move any cards into the reserve. The top card of the reserve can be played to the tableau or the foundation. </blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the card that could be played on a five would be a four of any suit.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with a card from the reserve. If the reserve is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>regardless of their suits</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Only one pass</b> through the stock is permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>Some versions (e.g., BVS, Solitaire Til Down and RaptureTech) require you to build down in alternate colors instead of regardless of color, but offer two redeals. I prefer to follow those who keep the distinctive name of "Rainbow" for a game a little more distinct from <a href="/help/canfield">Canfield</a>.</blockquote>
<h3>Similar Games:</h3><blockquote><dl><p></p><dt><b>Canfield</b> (<a href="/canfield" target="mainwin">Play</a>) (<a href="/help/canfield">Rules</a>)

<h3>Redeal:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau 1 time.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. The cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in bottom to top order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up. Deal the tableau in the same arrangement as it was originally dealt, one row at a time, starting with the bottom-most row, dealing the cards in each row in left to right order. </p></blockquote><h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter wrote a solver for this game and ran it on the first million Politaire seeds, 0 through 999999. It was able to solve all but 2,073 games, for a 99.8% win rate. Note that a few games can only be won by NOT removing all the cards that can be removed before redealing. About 88% of games can be won without using the redeal. Players will likely not achieve quite as high a win rate, but should come pretty close.</blockquote>

# Scorpion Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Scorpion Solitaire</span><a href="/scorpion" target="mainwin">Play Scorpion</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
A game with a seven-by-seven tableau, where three cards in the first four piles start face down. Unsorted stacks of cards can be moved around, as in <a href="/help/yukon">Yukon</a>, but cards cannot be moved to the foundation until they form complete sequences, as in <a href="/help/spider">Spider</a>. There are three cards in the reserve that you can deal onto the tableau at any time. The game was first described in the 1949 book <em>The Complete Book of Solitaire &amp; Patience</em> by Albert H. Morehead &amp; Geoffrey Mott-Smith.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> standard deck. Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards..</blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>Single cards may never be moved to the foundation. Only when you have constructed a <b>complete sequence</b> on the tableau, thirteen cards in sequence from ace to king, may you move it to the foundation.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Seven</b> tableau piles of cards, arranged as below, where "<tt>D</tt>" indicates a face-down card and "<tt>U</tt>" indicates a face-up card:<pre>  1  2  3  4  5  6  7

Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>kings only</b>.</p><p>
Furthermore, any face-up card anywhere in the tableau may be moved to another tableau column where it fits, taking all cards that were on top of it along.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the reserve.<p>
Each time you click on the reserve, a card will be dealt on top of each tableau pile.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>This is sometimes played with only the first three columns of the tableau containing three facedown cards instead of with the first four columns doing so. That version is sometimes called "Scorpion II."<p>If you allow any card to be played to empty tableau piles, instead of kings only, then this is called "Wasp."</p></blockquote>
<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Preliminary tests with a solver seem to indicate that only about 10% of deals are solvable. The "Scorpion II" variant seems to be somewhat harder, with about 8% of deals being solvable. The "Wasp" variant is much easier, with something like 75% of deals being solvable.</blockquote>

<h3>Redeals:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau 2 times.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards in the cells or on the tableau. First, the cards in the cells are collected from left to right.Then the cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in bottom to top order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up. First, deal the tableau in the same arrangement as it was originally dealt, one row at a time, starting with the bottom-most row, dealing the cards in each row in left to right order. Then, deal a card to each cell.</p></blockquote><h3>Common Variations:</h3><blockquote>There is a variation in which we build down by alternate colors instead of building up-and-down in suit.</blockquote>

<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>

Since colors don't matter, politaire substitutes a four-color deck of cards.<p>The two is the lowest card followed by three through king and then ace.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> foundation piles.
<p>A two is initially dealt to each foundation pile.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">9♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">10♥</span>.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Storehouse:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one storehouse</b>, initially containing <b>thirteen cards</b>.  The top card in the pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. It is not possible to move any cards into the storehouse. The top card of the storehouse can be played to the tableau or the foundation. </blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Four</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward.

<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>Jan Wolter ran a solver on the first million Politaire.com seeds and found 44% of games were solvable, removing an 31.6 hands. The game is easy enough that most players should have no difficulty achieving the same success rate.</blockquote>

<h3>Difficulty:</h3><blockquote>The paper referenced below says that between 82% and 91.5% of Thoughtful games are solvable, but this allows cards to be moved back from the foundation.<p>Many sources claim that games of Thoughtful are equivalent to games of Klondike - that is, if a Thoughtful game can be solved, then the equivaltent game of Klondike can also be solved. This is not true. Suppose that the top two cards of stack of a Thoughtful game were an <font color="red">8♥</font> on top of a 9♠. In Thoughtful the two cards can be moved as a unit. In Klondike they can't, because the 9♠ would be face down. If the 9♣ and the <font color="red">7♥</font> were both deeper in that stack, then the game would clearly be unsolvable in Klondike, but might be solvable in Thoughtful. Thus, it is clearly the case that more Thoughtful games are solvable than Klondike games.</p></blockquote>

# Three Demons Solitaire

<div class="content" id="content"><span class="title">Rules for Three Demons Solitaire</span><a href="/threedemons" target="mainwin">Play Three Demons</a>
<h3>Description:</h3><blockquote>
This three-deck version of <a href="/help/canfield">Canfield</a> invented by Thomas Warfield starts with more cards in the reserve and more tableau piles than <a href="/help/triplecanfield">Triple Canfield</a>.</blockquote><h3>Cards:</h3><blockquote><b>Three</b> standard decks<p>The rank of the lowest and highest card will be determined by the first card played into the foundation.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Twelve</b> foundation piles.
<p>A random card will be dealt to a foundation pile. This is the base card.  Start the remaining piles with cards of same rank. </p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="redcard">6♥</span> would be a <span class="redcard">7♥</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote>There is <b>one reserve</b>, initially containing <b>forty-eight cards</b>.  The top card in the pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. It is not possible to move any cards into the reserve. The top card of the reserve can be played to the tableau or the foundation. </blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Nine</b> tableau piles of <b>one</b> card each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>opposite color</b>.Thus, the cards that could be played on <span class="blackcard">6♣</span> would be <span class="redcard">5♥</span> or <span class="redcard">5♦</span>.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau are automatically filled with a card from the reserve. If the reserve is empty, then empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>high cards only</b>.</p><p>
Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved from one tableau column to another <b>if the cards are alternately red and black</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>three cards</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Unlimited passes</b> through the stock are permitted. At the end of any pass where there are not enough cards left in the deck just the remaining cards are dealt. The waste will be flipped over to become a new stock before the next deal.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau or the foundation.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Redeals:</h3><blockquote>You may pick up and redeal the cards on the tableau 2 times.<p>The redeal procedure begins by picking up all cards on the tableau. The cards from the tableau are collected, one column at a time, starting with the left-most column, picking up the cards in each column in bottom to top order. Then, without shuffling, the cards are dealt out again, starting with the first card picked up. Deal the tableau in the same arrangement as it was originally dealt, starting by dealing all the face-down cards (marked with a 'D' above) row-by-row in a zig-zag pattern, then dealing the face up cards row-by-row, dealing each row left-to-right. If any stacks end up with a face down card on top, turn it face up.</p></blockquote><h3>References:</h3><blockquote><a href="http://docs.kde.org/development/en/kdegames/kpat/rules-specific.html#grandfather" target="_blank">KPatience</a><br/>

<h3>Goal:</h3><blockquote>Move all cards to the foundation.</blockquote>
<h3>Foundation:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> foundation piles.
<p>Any king may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.</p><p>A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is <b>one higher</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of the <b>same suit</b>.Thus, the only card that could be played on a <span class="bluecard">4♦</span> would be a <span class="bluecard">5♦</span>. No pile may contain more than 13 cards.</p><p>Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..</p></blockquote><h3>Tableau:</h3><blockquote><b>Eight</b> tableau piles of <b>five</b> cards each, splayed downward. All cards are dealt face up.<p>A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is <b>one lower</b> than  the old top card of the pile and of <b>any suit</b>.Thus, the card that could be played on a jack would be a ten of any suit.</p><p>Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation, any other tableau pile or the reserve pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by <b>queens only</b>.</p><p>
Only one card may moved at a time, never sequences.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Reserve:</h3><blockquote><b>One</b> reserve pile, initially empty.<p>Cards from other tableau or reserve piles may be added to the reserve <b>regardless of suit or rank</b>.That is, any card may be played on any other card. Cards from the waste may not be moved to the reserve.</p><p>Cards on the reserve that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any tableau pile.</p><p>
Empty spaces in the reserve may be filled by <b>any card</b>.</p><p>
Only one card may moved at a time, never sequences.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Stock and Waste:</h3><blockquote>The remaining cards form the stock and there is <b>one waste pile</b>.<p>
Each time you click on the stock, <b>one card</b> will be dealt from the stock to the waste. <b>Only one pass</b> through the stock is permitted.</p><p>
The top card of the waste is available for play to the tableau, any empty reserve pile or the foundation.</p></blockquote>
