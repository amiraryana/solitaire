<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Fifty-four spaces in five rows of nine and a last row of seven. Deal cards face up one per space. The spaces should be considered as one continuous line, the rows simply arrange the tableau so all of it can be seen at once. Thus the rightmost space of a row is to be considered to the left of the leftmost space of the row below.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>To remove all cards except one.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved over another card of the same suit or rank that is in the space immediately to its left or three spaces to its left. The card that is covered is removed from play. All the cards (if any) in spaces to the right of the resulting gap are moved to the left one space so as to close the gap. Double-clicking causes the card to move three spaces, if possible, or failing that one space to the left.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card removed scores 1 point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 51</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>This is a difficult game. Try to find two or three cards of the same rank at or near the last row. Try not to remove any card of this rank. At the end you can move these cards onto each other to win.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Cards are dealt in batches of seven, one on every Tableau pile.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles top right. To be built in suit and sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. One card is dealt on to the first Foundation pile. The other Foundation piles must be started with cards of the same rank.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Seven piles. Deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all the covered piles. Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile. Tableau can be built down in same colors. Groups of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by the next deal from the Stock.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Groups of cards in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit.</p>
<p>Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the Tableau. There are no redeals.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in Foundation scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Try to build down in suit whenever possible. Try to score as many points as you can as this game is very hard to win.</p>

<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Two redeals.</p>
<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King. Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Seven piles. Four rows, the first row is face down, the second row is face up, the third row is face down, and the fourth and final row is face up. Essentially Athena is the same as Klondike only the opening layout is different. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Builds of cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.</p>
<p>Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t give up the ship! Try brute force methods when the game seems over. Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. All cards except the Aces are placed here at the start of play. Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the four Reserve piles.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles on top, to the right of Stock. Place an Ace on each Foundation to begin the game. The Foundation piles are to be built up regardless of suit.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Four piles placed underneath Foundations. Each time Stock is clicked, one card will be placed on each Reserve pile. Top card is available for play. Reserve cards can only be moved on to Foundations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards on to Foundations.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Play begins by dealing four cards to the Reserve. If possible, play cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve. Continue this process until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on to Foundation can be made. A similar game that is a bit easier is Scuffle.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card removed scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Do you believe in Luck? Although this game takes more skill to play than Clock, the skill involved entails paying attention. A great game for brainless play.</p>

<p>The Tableau is built down by suit. Only the top card or build of cards can be moved.

Empty spaces in the Tableau can only be filled with a King or a build starting with a King.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up by suit from Ace to King. Although cards in the Foundations are technically still in play, there really is no need as playing these cards are not in any way helpful.</p>
<p>Any top card in the Tableau can be placed in an empty Reserve slot. These cards are available for play back into the Tableau or on to a Foundation pile.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles at top. One card is dealt face up in the first Foundation pile.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>There are 18 Tableau piles arranged in three rows of six piles each. All cards are dealt face up and fanned, such that all cards are visible. The first five piles of each row start with three cards each. The sixth pile of each row starts with two cards each.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>One random card has already been dealt to a Foundation pile. The rank of that card becomes the Base Card. The other three cards with the same rank can be moved to an empty Foundation. Foundations are built up in ascending order, matching suit. Cards can &quot;wrap-around&quot; from Queen to King to Ace to Two. Cards on the Foundations may not be moved back onto Tableau piles.</p>
<p>None of the Tableau piles can have more than three cards. The top card of each Tableau pile can be moved to any other Tableau pile if it matches suit and has a face value of one higher or one lower than the top card of the pile it is being moved to. Cards can &quot;wrap-around&quot; between King and Ace.</p>
<p>There are two types of Tableau piles: &quot;Standard&quot; piles, and &quot;Hole&quot; piles. The first five piles of each row (the ones with three cards) are the Standard piles. An empty standard pile CANNOT have a new card placed on it. The last pile of each row (the ones with two cards) are the Hole piles. An empty Hole pile CAN have a new card placed on it.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card moved to the Foundation scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Try to free up one or more Hole piles early.</p>
<p>There is never a disadvantage in moving cards to the Foundations. Move as many as possible, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Cards that have a rank one lower than the Base Card can be very difficult to move. Be careful where you place them.</p>
<p>Bear River can be won about one third of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Eight slots (four to the left and four to the right of Foundations.) Deal all cards face up and extended on to these eight piles so that there are six cards in each pile and all cards are showing.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down regardless of suit. Only one card can be moved at a time. Empty piles can be filled with any single card.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>All the cards are placed in the Stock at the beginning of the game. Cards are turned over one at a time to waste. No redeals.</p>
<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>To be taken from Stock. Can only hold one card which must immediately be played on to Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Four by four grid, each capable of holding one card. Kings can only be placed in a corner space. Queens can only be placed in the middle two spaces of first and last row. Jacks can only be placed in the middle two spaces of first and last column.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Remove all cards but picture cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings). You have won if your Tableau looks like this --</p>
<pre><code>K Q Q K
J E E J
J E E J
K Q Q K
</code></pre>
<p>-- and your Stock and Waste are empty. The suits do not matter.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>There are two phases to this game. Alternate between the two phases until game is lost or won. Start with Phase One until Tableau is completely filled. At that point, move to Phase Two. Please note that you cannot begin Phase Two unless the Tableau is completely filled. At any point, you can return to Phase One, but remember that you cannot go back to Phase Two unless the tableau is once again filled. An exception to this rule is if the stock and waste are empty.</p>
<p>Phase One -- Click on the Stock to move a card into the empty Waste pile. If card is a:</p>
<ul>
<li>King: Place in one of the empty four corner spaces.</li>
<li>Queen: Place in one of the empty middle two spaces of the top or bottom row.</li>
<li>Jack: Place in any of the empty middle two spaces of the leftmost or rightmost column.</li>
<li>Any other card: Place in any empty space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase Two -- Remove 10&#39;s singly by clicking on them. Remove pairs that add up to 10 by dragging one card on top of its pair.</p>
<p>Game is lost if a picture card cannot be put in an appropriate spot or if all the spaces are filled and no cards can be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card removed scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 40</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>It is always safest in the middle. During Phase One of play, deal in the middle before going to the edges. If you see a possible pair, place that card on the edge so as to free more edge spaces during Phase Two of play.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing. Cards are turned over three at a time to Waste. Unlimited redeals.</p>
<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>Directly to the right of Stock. To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>On left under stock. Deal thirteen cards here with top card face up. Top card available for play to Foundations or Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Four piles below Foundations. Deal one card face up on to each pile. Tableau can be built down in alternating color. Groups of cards can be moved.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles top right. Deal one card face up on first Foundation pile. This card is now the base card. Built up by suit.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Groups of cards can be moved. An empty slot in the Tableau is filled automatically from the Reserve. If the Reserve is empty, an empty slot can be filled by any card or group of cards in sequence.</p>
<p>Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste by three. If the last flip has less than three cards, that many cards are flipped for that move only. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card dealt to first Foundation) New Foundations are started when a card of the same rank as the first card placed during the dealing period are placed on empty Foundation piles. Aces are placed on Kings, and twos on Aces. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point. This game used to be played in casinos. You would break even if your score is 10.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. This game is hard to win. Most people play with the betting rules in mind and try to get as many points as possible. To this end, always move cards into the Foundations as soon as they are available.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Deal cards in a clock shape, for a total of twelve piles with four cards each.</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Place last four cards in the Stock pile (middle of the Tableau) Flip over top card.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>To reveal all the cards.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Move the top card in the middle to the appropriate pile. The Tableau is in the shape of a clock, and so the numbered cards go where they would on an analog clock. Aces go where the ones go, and the Jacks and Queens go where the elevens and twelves go respectively. For all the people who have never had an analog watch/clock, this is the pattern:</p>
<p>Kings are kept in the middle pile. When a card is moved to a new pile (or made to stay in the same pile, as the case is with the King), the bottom card in the new pile is taken and placed on top of the middle pile face up. This new card is ready for play. To move a card to the appropriate pile, either drag the card over or double click on the appropriate receptor pile.</p>
<p>Game is over when there are four kings in the middle. At this point, you&#39;ve won if goal is achieved. Note that if a card in a pile is in the right place it is okay even if it is faced down.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in the appropriate pile of the clock (not counting Kings, as there are no Kings on real clocks) scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Find a way to automate this game. There are no decisions ever to be made. If you lose it&#39;s not your fault. (Contrariwise, if you win, it&#39;s just luck!)</p>

<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left slot. Since all remaining cards are always dealt to the tableau, it will always be empty. Redeals are unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Rightmost piles in the top row; the aces are placed here upon the start of the game. Build up in suit from ace to king.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Up to thirteen piles, dealt four cards at a time until the stock is exhausted. Tableau piles can be built down in suit.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Build foundations up in suit and tableau piles down in suit. If no moves are available (or you just feel like it), click on the empty top left slot for a redeal.</p>
<p>Redeals are accomplished by placing the tableau piles on top of each other in order, starting from the last pile. Then the deck is simply turned over and redealt, four cards at a time, back to the tableau. If no moves are made, redealing will not alter the arrangement of the cards. Therefore, the game is lost if no move is possible immediately after a redeal.</p>
<p>Note: a degenerate case occurs whenever, after a redeal, the last tableau pile contains only one card and the only move possible is from the final tableau pile one before it. Making this move and redealing only results in the original card arrangement. AisleRiot will end the game if this situation is detected.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card placed in the foundation piles scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>If more than one pile on the tableau can be built upon, choose to build upon the one with the highest rank first.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Remove all diamonds to the foundation and have all the other cards in suit and sequence with Aces being low in the Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards (other than diamonds) can be built down in sequence regardless of suit. Builds of cards can be moved as a unit. Empty slots can be filled by any card (except for diamonds) or build of cards.</p>
<p>Diamonds cannot be moved except to be place on to the Foundation. The diamond Foundation must be built up in sequence but can start from any number you want.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each diamond placed on to the Foundation scores the face value of the card, with Ace as one point, Jacks as eleven points, Queens as twelve points, and Kings as thirteen points.</p>
<p>Each Ace through King in sequence and in suit on the Tableau pile scores three points.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 100</p>

<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>Directly to the right of Stock. To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles top right. One card is dealt in the first Foundation at the start of the game, this is the base card. Other Foundations must be started with a card of the same rank as the base card. To be built up in suit from the base card.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Middle (and lowest) slot. Deal thirteen cards face down here. Flip card to fill any spaces in the Tableau. When only one card is left in the Reserve, it will flip up and can be played on Foundation or a Tableau pile.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Eight slots (four to the left and four to the right of Reserve.) Deal one card face up per slot. Tableau can be built down by suit. Cards can be moved singly to other slots on the Tableau, or in a group on to the Foundation. Each Tableau slot can hold a maximum of three cards.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the tableau are built down by suit. Cards can only be moved singly to another Tableau pile. However, to ease monotony, groups of cards can be moved to Foundation. An empty slot in the Tableau is filled automatically from the Reserve. If the Reserve is empty, an empty slot can be filled by a card from the Waste or from another Tableau pile.</p>
<p>The Reserve exists mainly to deal cards into empty slots of the Tableau. However, when there is only one card left in the Reserve, it will become visible and is in play.</p>
<p>Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste singly. When the Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card dealt to first Foundation). New Foundations are started when a card of the same rank as the first card placed during the dealing period are placed on empty Foundation piles. Aces are placed on Kings, and twos on Aces. Cards in Foundations are not in play.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>

<p>A little planning goes a long way. Check before piling cards in a Tableau. Remember the three card in a slot rule.</p>

<p>Any empty Tableau slots must be filled if possible before dealing more cards. Clicking on the Stock deals one card face up on to each Tableau pile. The last deal places one card face up on the first three piles. There are no redeals.</p>
<p>The Foundation is built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in the Foundation are no longer in play.</p>

<p>Each card placed on to a Foundation scores one point.</p>

<p>Move cards up to the Foundation when you can because the next deal may block it. However since cards in the Foundation are no longer in play, you may get stuck later needing that card. Hopefully this conundrum will be the most difficult one facing you today.</p>

<p>Foundations are built up by suit from Ace to King. Although cards in the Foundations are technically still in play, there really is no need as playing these cards are not in any way helpful.</p>
<p>Any top card in the Tableau can be placed in an empty Reserve slot. These cards are available for play back into the Tableau or on to a Foundation pile.</p>

<p>Top left pile. All cards are placed here in beginning. When emptied, cards are brought back from Tableau and put back in the Stock.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Four piles on the right. Each deal from Stock will deal one card to each Tableau pile.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Remove all cards.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the Tableau piles. If any of the cards showing in the Tableau are of the same rank, move the others on to the leftmost of the like cards. Empty piles can only be filled by an ensuing deal from Stock.</p>
<p>If at any point, all four cards showing are the same rank, they are removed.</p>
<p>When Stock is empty, the Tableau piles are gathered, right pile on left, and placed back into stock. The first card dealt will always be the first card dealt until it is removed. There are unlimited redeals.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each set of four cards removed scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 13</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t forget to use the brakes! This game might never end unless you decide carefully whether or not to make a move.</p>

<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>All cards are dealt into four rows of 13 cards each; the aces are then discarded to leave four gaps. Two redeals are allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>To place all cards in sequence from 2 to king, in suit.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Gaps in the leftmost column may be filled by moving a 2 of any suit there. A gap to the right of any non-King card may be filled by placing the card with the same suit but one rank higher into the gap. Gaps following Kings or other gaps may not be filled.</p>
<p>Once a card is placed in a sequence starting with a 2 in the leftmost slot, it can no longer be moved.</p>
<p>If no moves are possible (i.e., all gaps follow Kings), double-clicking any card will cause a redeal. Any cards not in sequence will be removed, shuffled, and redealt. Only two redeals are allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>Randomly Placed Gaps on Redeal: Check this to have randomly placed gaps after a redeal. If unchecked, the gaps will always be placed directly to the right of any cards already in sequence after redealing.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card placed in sequence, starting with a two in the leftmost slot, is worth one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>

<p>Put off making any move that will add a gap after a king for as long as possible.</p>

Double clicking on a Foundation will automatically move as many cards as possible to the Foundations.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to play. The difference between them is in how the cards may be built in the tableau.</p>
<p>Same suit</p>
<p>Cards must be of the same suit to be moved as a group and must be placed on a card of the same suit.</p>
<p>Alternating colors</p>
<p>To be moved as a group cards must be in a sequence of alternating colors. The top card must be placed on a card of the opposite color.</p>

<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. The first three cards may be turned over one at a time to Chooser. After choosing a Start card, clicking on Stock deals one card face up to each pile in the Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Chooser</strong></p>
<p>Top left, next to Stock. While the Start card is being chosen, clicking Stock deals the top card face up to Chooser. The card in Chooser can be moved to a Foundation. Or if Stock is clicked again, it is returned face down to the bottom of Stock, and the next card moved to Chooser.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from the chosen Start card to King, then Ace to the card with value one less than the Start Card.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Seven piles. Deal one card face up to each pile. Start the second row on the second pile in the Tableau, and deal one card face up to each pile except the first. Repeat, till there are seven cards in the last pile. The Tableau can be built down by matching color. Groups of cards in order and in suit can be moved. Empty piles can be filled by any card or group of cards in order and in suit.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>To start the game, one card is flipped over from the Stock to the Chooser. This card can be moved to a Foundation, in which case it is the Start card for this game. Otherwise, the card in the Chooser is returned face down to the bottom of the stock, and the next card flipped over from Stock to Chooser. If none of the first three cards is chosen, the game is over. Double clicking on the Chooser will move the card there to a Foundation.</p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by color. A King may be placed on an Ace (unless the Start card is Ace). Groups of cards that are in suit can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with any card, or with a group of cards that are in order and all the same suit.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit from the Start card to King, then Ace, Two, and so on to one less than the Start card. For example, if the Start card is Seven, the Foundations are built up from Seven to King, Ace to Six. Cards in Foundations are still in play.</p>
<p>A group of cards that are in order and all the same suit can be moved to a Foundation in a single move. Double clicking on a pile in the Tableau will move all possible cards from that pile to the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card removed scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Choose wisely. If you cannot move to the Foundation all visible cards of the Start value, you are unlikely to win. An empty slot in the Tableau is invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>Dedication</strong></p>
<p>This game is dedicated to, and named for, my father: Geoffrey Hamilton Goodwin (b. 1937). He taught me many patience (or solitaire) games; we both consider Hamilton the most interesting single-pack game.</p>

<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. All cards except the Ace to four of clubs are placed here at beginning of play. Cards are dealt singly to Waste.</p>
<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>Directly to the right of Stock. Can only hold one card at a time. Card must immediately be placed on either a Foundation pile or on to the Reserve pile of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles on top, to the right of Stock. Place an Ace on the first pile, a two on the second pile, a three on the third pile, and a four on the fourth pile. The first Foundation pile is built up by one, the second is built up by two, the third by three, and the fourth by four, all of which wrap around to Ace when it reaches past thirteen. cards in Foundations are no longer in play. Suits do not matter.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Four piles placed underneath Foundations. Cards in Reserve can only be played on to Foundation piles. Cards moved from Waste can be placed on any of the Reserve piles.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards on to Foundations.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Build on to Foundations by ones, twos, threes, and fours for piles one, two, three, and four respectively. Cards are dealt singly in to the Waste from the Stock. However, as the Waste pile can only hold one card, this card must immediately be played on to a Foundation pile or on to any of the four Reserve piles. Cards in the Reserve piles cannot be rearranged.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card moved to Foundations scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Hone your skills for this game. Luck will not get you very far here. Try not to cover cards you might need sooner. Consider saving a column just for kings (as they are the last card to be played on each Foundation).</p>

<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Thirteen piles. Deal three cards face down and one card face up on every pile.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Remove all cards.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Remove cards in pairs of equal rank. Every time a card is removed, the card underneath is flipped face up and becomes playable. Empty slots are not filled.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each pair of cards removed scores two points.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Each pile starts with four cards. The trick is to remember how many cards each slot has left at any given time so that you can try to remove cards evenly.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Groups of cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.</p>
<p>Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.</p>
<p>Double clicking on a foundation card will move all the cards that can be moved to the foundation to the foundation. This is useful for cleaning up at the end of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>There are three possible ways to play. The difference between them is in how the cards are dealt from the stock.</p>
<p><strong>Three card deals</strong></p>
<p>Cards are dealt from the stock three at a time. There is no limit to how many times you can redeal the stock.</p>
<p><strong>Single card deals</strong></p>
<p>Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time. However you can only turn the stock over and redeal twice.</p>
<p><strong>No redeals</strong></p>
<p>Cards are dealt one at a time from the stock. There is no redeal. Play this way if you want a challenge (and some frustration).</p>
<p><strong>Unlimited redeals</strong></p>
<p>Cards are dealt one at a time from the stock. There is no limit to how many times you can redeal the stock.</p>
<p>Most likely you will consider one of the first two methods traditional - depending on where you live and who taught you. The no redeals option is the one normally found in older sets of rules, but the game is rarely played that way.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t give up the ship! Try brute force methods when the game seems over. Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.</p>

<p>48 cards: Standard Deck without the kings</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Fifty-four spaces in six rows of nine each. Deal cards into spaces one to eight. Leave space nine blank. Deal cards into spaces ten to seventeen. Leave space eighteen blank. Deal the remaining cards similarly. Then remove all the kings (which play no further part in the game), so that six empty spaces remain in total. Any card can be moved into a space to the left of another card of the same suit and face value one higher. Any card can be moved into a space to the right of another card of the same suit and face value one lower. An ace may be moved to the right of a queen or in the top left space. A queen may be moved to the left of an ace or in the bottom right space.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Put each suit of cards into ascending order, with an ace in the top left corner, to create a run of cards: Ace to Queen of one suit, Ace to Queen of another, Ace to Queen of the third, Ace to Queen of the fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved into a space to the left of another card of face value one higher in the same suit. Any card can be moved into a space to the right of another card of face value one lower in the same suit. An ace may be moved to the right of a queen or in the top left space. A queen may be moved to the left of an ace or in the bottom right space.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card placed next to another card of the same suit in the correct order scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Multiple adjacent spaces enable you to generate long sequences of cards. Beware of getting trapped into a situation where you move one card endlessly between two points.</p>

<p>Cards can be removed in pairs that have the same value as long as the two cards are touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
<p>At any point that there are empty piles in the Tableau, dealing from the Stock moves all the cards already in the Tableau from the right to left and moving them up a row to the far right if necessary making all the empty slots at the end. The Stock is then dealt on to these empty slots.</p>

<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Any card of the suit in the first Foundation can be played on to this Foundation pile at any time. Each ensuing Foundation can only be started with a card of the same rank as this first card. Once started, these latter foundations can be built on in suit as long as a card of the same rank already exists in the Foundation directly above it. Play cards from Reserves whenever possible following these rules.</p>
<p>Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>Three card deals: Deal three cards at a time from Stock to Waste and enable unlimited redeals.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>One point for every card placed on Foundation.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The Reserves are open for you to see. Choose your suit order wisely.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Fifteen piles, arranged in rows of four. Deal cards four at a time, face up onto the first thirteen piles. Leave the last two spaces empty. A pile can hold as many as four cards, and as few as none.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Rearrange the cards so that each pile contains all four cards from a single value. This should leave two piles empty, but it doesn&#39;t matter whether they are the same piles which were empty at the start.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards can be moved on top of any other card or cards of the same value so long as no pile grows to have more than four cards. Groups of cards can be moved if they are of the same value, but it doesn&#39;t gain you anything. An empty slot can be filled with any card or group of cards with the same value.</p>
<p>Once a pile contains all four cards of the same value it is frozen, and the top card is flipped to indicate that you need do nothing further to those cards. They are no longer in play, but it would be useless to move them anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>When a pile of four cards is frozen you score 4 points, one for each card. There is no other way to score points.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Keep one of the piles clear as much as possible. Don&#39;t allow a pile of three cards to build up on top of a single card, especially if the final card from the set is not a bottom card in another pile.</p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>All eight Foundations have to be started with the same card value. At the beginning you can choose whether to build up or down. You can take cards from the plait in the middle of the tableau, from the eight free fields left and right of the plait, from the four edges around the plait, and from the waste.</p>
<p>The game is lost if no available cards can be moved on to the Foundation piles and the Stock is empty.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>No scoring. You either win or lose.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Pick the cards from the plait as soon as possible as they are hard to free. Then pick the cards from the tableau as it will give you empty slots to temporarily store some cards.</p>

<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Empty spaces in the Tableau are immediately filled in with cards from the Stock.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Five-by-five grid, each capable of holding one card. One card dealt to each space at the beginning of the game. Empty spaces are filled in from the Stock. Once Stock is exhausted, spaces are filled by moving cards from the right to the left, from the leftmost card of the row below to the the rightmost space, leaving all empty spaces at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Remove all cards.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards can be removed in pairs if they add up to fourteen (with Jacks being 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13) and are in the same row or column.</p>
<p>Empty slots are automatically filled from the Stock. Once the Stock is exhausted, cards to the right of empty piles are automatically moved over to fill the space, with empty piles in the right column filled in by the cards of the leftmost column in the row below.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each pair of cards removed scores two points.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Oftentimes in the middle of this game, there is only one move. Make it. Once the Stock is exhausted, there is much more movement in the Tableau.</p>

<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>

<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King. Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Seven piles. Place one card face up on all piles. Next row skip the first pile and place cards on all the other piles. Continue this process skipping one place to the right each row until there are seven rows with seven cards in the last pile. Essentially Saratoga is the same as Klondike only the all cards are face up to begin with. Being able to see all cards reduces the element of risk and makes Saratoga slightly easier than Klondike. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Builds of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>

<p>Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t give up the ship! Try brute force methods when the game seems over. Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Four piles -- two top left, two top right. Built from Ace to King in suit.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Four piles at top in the center. Each reserve can only hold one card. Two of the reserves are each dealt one card to start.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>The Tableau is built down by suit. Only the top card or build of cards can be moved. A build of cards can only be moved if the number of cards in the build is equal or less than one more than the number of Reserve slots free. Empty spaces in the Tableau can only be filled with a King or a build starting with a King.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up by suit from Ace to King. Although cards in the Foundations are technically still in play, there really is no need as playing these cards are not in any way helpful.</p>
<p>Any top card in the Tableau can be placed in an empty Reserve slot. These cards are available for play back into the Tableau or on to a Foundation pile.</p>
<p>As a convenience, sequences of the same suit can be moved onto the matching Foundation pile rather than being moved individually. This is especially useful at the end of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card placed on to the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Move any card you can on to the Foundations as soon as possible. Leaving them around can only hinder your movement.</p>

<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Top eight piles. Only used to hold sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace once completed.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Ten piles. Four piles (piles 1, 4, 7, and 10) get dealt 5 cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 4 cards down and one card up. Cards can be built down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or movable unit.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>To have eight sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace in the foundation.</p>
<p>If you want an extremely difficult challenge, do not move completed sequences of cards to a foundation. You can also win by leaving the same eight sequences in the tableau. This is harder because there are fewer empty piles available. In fact, it is nearly impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Build down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal sequence.</p>
<p>Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every pile. However, all piles must be non-empty. If an empty pile exists, an error message will appear.</p>
<p>A sequence of cards going down from King down to Ace can be moved to a foundation pile. Once there, these cards are no longer in play.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>There are three possible types of deck. Each deck has 104 cards.</p>
<p>One Suit</p>
<p>The deck is an octuple deck of Spades only. This is the simplest of the spider decks and a good way to learn the basics.</p>
<p>Two Suits</p>
<p>The deck is a quadruple deck of Hearts and Spades only. There are four complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is not quite as diabolical as the standard four suit spider deck.</p>
<p>Four Suits</p>
<p>The deck is a standard double deck. There are two complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is the standard Spider deck. It is also the most difficult.</p>
<p>Many traditional implementations of Spider do not use a foundation and simply remove completed sequences of cards. This has no impact upon game play.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>For every sequence in suit, points given is (length of sequence - 1).</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 96</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>If at first you don&#39;t succeed, don&#39;t become addicted. Build in suit whenever possible, but expose as many cards as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Deck</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Spots</strong></p>
<p>Locations to place one card out of play. The spots begin the game filled. One version of the game does not allow you to put new cards into these spots once they are empty.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Ten piles across the bottom. To deal place 10 cards across going from left to right with the first and last cards face up. Continuing you place ten cards across the piles from right to left (reversed) with the first two and last two cards placed face up. Continue this pattern (reversed and one more card each pass) until 50 cards have been placed. Place the last two cards in the temporary spots at the top.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Form four piles in the tableau all of the same suit running from King to Ace.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Only a King may be moved to a blank tableau spot.</p>
<p>Cards may be moved only onto other cards if the suit matches and the moved card is one less than the moved to. This includes moving a pile of cards of different suits as long as the top card of the moved pile matches the bottom card of the location moved to.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>Allow temporary spots use: If checked the temporary spots may be reused.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>You win or lose. There is no scoring.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>This game is hard to win (being very influenced by how the cards are placed to begin with). Don&#39;t forget you have the temporary spots. Try to clear them quickly because they are very useful when you get stuck.</p>

<p>Double Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Reserve and on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>To be taken from the Stock. Top card available for play.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Eleven cards dealt face up in a pile. All cards are visible but only top card is in play.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Eight piles in the middle. To be built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Nine cards dealt face up from the deck once based card is selected.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down in sequence by alternating colours building round the corner. Groups of cards can&#39;t be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau must be filled by the top card in Waste or the next card from the Stock. Top cards can be moved to the Foundation or other Tableau piles.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. Empty Foundations must be filled with the base card that is selected by the user from four random cards as the first move. Cards in Foundations are out of play.</p>
<p>Top card of the Reserve is in play and can only be moved to Foundations.</p>
<p>Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually as many times as you like unless there is a space in the tableau. If there is a space in the tableau then only one card may be flipped from the stock to the waste until the tableau is filled or the top card of the waste is moved to the foundation or tableau. While the stock is locked you can still move cards around on the tableau, from the reserve and to the foundation. If the Waste is empty a card from the Stock is automatically dealt. Top card in Waste is in play. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p>Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>There are seven ways to play. The difference between them is in number of Reserve cards, Tableau piles or choice of Base Card.</p>
<p>Terrace</p>
<p>Reserve of 11 cards, 9 Tableau piles. Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. User selection of the base card from a choice of four at the start of the game and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p>General Patience</p>
<p>Reserve of 13 cards, 9 Tableau piles. Foundations are built up in sequence by suit from the base card. User selection of the base card from a choice of four at the start of the game and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile. Stock can be turned once but the game is lost if you cannot play each new card after its turned.</p>
<p>Falling Stars</p>
<p>Reserve of 11 cards, 9 Tableau piles. Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p>Signora</p>
<p>Reserve of 11 cards, 9 Tableau piles. Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile. Spaces in the Tableau are automatically filled from the Waste or Stock if the Waste is empty. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p>Redheads</p>
<p>Reserve of 21 cards, 8 Tableau piles. Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile. Spaces in the Tableau are automatically filled from the Reserve or any card if the Reserve is empty. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p>Blondes and Brunettes</p>
<p>Reserve of 10 cards, 8 Tableau piles. Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p>Wood</p>
<p>Reserve of 10 cards, 9 Tableau piles. Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile. Stock cannot be turned.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>When the game starts examine the Reserve carefully before choosing your base card, avoid base cards that have several buried in the Reserve.</p>
<p>Watch for reversed sequences in the Stock, Reserve a Foundation to remove each reversed sequence.</p>
<p>Try to start Tableau piles from the last card needed to complete a Foundation.</p>
<p>Remember that you can continue to flip cards from the stock while it is locked without filling the tableau by using the top card of the waste.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Deck</strong></p>
<p>Standard Double Deck</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>Bottom left pile of 39 cards. Cards are turned over three at a time to Waste.</p>
<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>Three rightmost piles at the bottom row. To be taken from Stock one on to each at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
<p>Wall, Low Guard Post, High Guard Post and Throne.</p>
<p><strong>Wall</strong></p>
<p>45 cards in six rows.</p>
<p><strong>Low Guard Post</strong></p>
<p>Four piles of three cards, placed face down initially.</p>
<p><strong>High Guard Post</strong></p>
<p>Three piles of two cards.</p>
<p><strong>Throne</strong></p>
<p>A pile with two kings of spades.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Remove the two kings in Throne.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>You start from the bottom of Wall and try to move up to Throne by removing cards on the way. You can remove cards by attacking them with Waste cards that are dealt three at a time from Stock. If Stock runs out and you cannot remove the kings in Throne with the remaining cards in Waste, the game is lost.</p>
<p>Waste cards used in attacks are called  attack cards. An attack on any card or pile succeeds if the  health  of the attack cards exceeds the health of the attacked card or pile. Health is computed as a sum of card values as explained below. A successful attack removes both the attacked cards and the attack cards.</p>
<p><strong>Order of removing cards</strong></p>
<p>The basic rule is to remove cards immediately above and next to already empty Tableau slots.</p>
<p><strong>Wall</strong></p>
<p>From the beginning all cards in the bottom row of Wall can be removed. Furthermore, you can remove any card if a card covering its bottom left or right corner has been removed or a card in the same (horizontal) row next to it has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Low Guard Post</strong></p>
<p>A pile can be removed when one of the two cards in Wall immediately below it has been removed or a pile next to it in Low Guard Post has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>High Guard Post</strong></p>
<p>A pile can be removed once the pile closest to its bottom left corner or the pile closest to its bottom right corner in Low Guard Post has been removed, or a pile next to it in High Guard Post has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Throne</strong></p>
<p>Can be removed when all piles in High Guard Post have been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<p>For attack cards, health is the sum of card values.</p>
<p>For most Wall cards, health is the sum of values of the card and the cards touching its top left and right corners. For the cards in the top row of Wall, health is just the card&#39;s value. For the cards on the left and right edge of Wall, health is the sum of values of the card, the only card touching its top corner and the card immediately above it.</p>
<p>For the piles in Low Guard Post, High Guard Post and Throne, a whole pile must be removed at once. A pile&#39;s health is the sum of values of the cards in that pile.</p>
<p>Ace is low.</p>
<p><strong>Attacking</strong></p>
<p>You can attack with any combination of Waste cards by piling them and dragging the pile on the card you want to attack. Clicking a Tableau card attacks the clicked card with all cards in Waste. New cards can be dealt from Stock on to Waste at any time. Dealing new cards discards the cards that were in Waste before.</p>
<p>The piles in Low Guard Post behave differently from others. The first attack on any of these piles flips the cards in the pile face up and removes the attack cards. If this first attack succeeds, the pile is removed as normal. If the attack fails, subsequent failing attacks on that pile do not cause attack cards to be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Other rules</strong></p>
<p>Double-clicking a Tableau card is an action shortcut. It has the same effect as clicking (see Attacking) and in addition causes new cards to be dealt from Stock on to Waste regardless of whether the attack was successful or not.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each successful attack scores the health of the attacked card or pile.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>It is best to move as directly up as possible. Try to find an easy path through Wall before starting off.</p>
<p>Try not to waste cards, but make as many attacks as possible before dealing new cards.</p>
<p>When trying to remove a Low Guard Post pile, it is often a good idea to first flip the cards over by attacking them with a low-valued card, and after that to decide whether to try through there or through some other Low Guard Post pile. Note that the expectation of a Low Guard Post pile&#39;s health is a little less than 21.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Remove all cards.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p>All exposed cards in the pyramid are available for play. Kings can be removed singly. All other cards can be removed in pairs that add up to treize with Aces equal to 1, Jacks equal to 11, and Queens equal to 12.</p>

<p>Each card removed scores one point.</p>
<p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>

<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p><strong>Base card</strong></p>
<p>The first card dealt into a foundation pile. Other foundations usually have to start with a card of this rank. See: Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Build by alternate color</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card on to another card of the opposite color is permitted. Example: Placing a Diamond on a Spade is good, but placing a Diamond on a Heart is not.</p>
<p><strong>Build by any suit but own</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card on to another card of any suit but the suit of the original card is permitted. Example: Placing a Diamond on a Heart is good, but placing a Heart on a Heart is not.</p>

<p><strong>Build regardless of suit</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s all good.</p>
<p><strong>Build by suit</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card on to another card of the same suit is permitted. Example: Placing a Spade on a Spade is good, but placing a Spade on a Club is not.</p>
<p><strong>Build down</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card of a lower rank on to a card of a higher rank is permitted. Usually implies a difference of only one ranking between the two cards. Example: Placing a 10 on a Jack is good, but placing a 10 on a 9 is not.</p>
<p><strong>Build down by [x]</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card of a lower rank on to a card of a higher rank by * is permitted. Example: If * is 2, placing a 10 on a Queen is good, but placing a 10 on a Jack is not.</p>
<p><strong>Build up</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card of a higher rank on to a card of a lower rank is permitted. Usually implies a difference of only one ranking between the two cards. Example: Placing a Queen on a Jack is good, but placing a Queen on a King is not.</p>
<p><strong>Build up by [x]</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card of a higher rank on to a card of a lower rank by * is permitted. Example: If * is 2, placing a 10 on an 8 is good, but placing a 10 on a 9 is not.</p>
<p><strong>Build up or down</strong></p>
<p>Building by placing a card on to a card of one higher or one lower rank is permitted. Example: Placing a Jack on a Queen or a 10 is good, but placing a 10 on a Queen is not.</p>
<p><strong>Building</strong></p>
<p>The ability to place a card (or group of cards) on another card. In regards to rank, you can build up, build down, or build up/down by *. In regards to suit/color, you can build by suit, build by color, build by alternate color, build by any suit but own, or build regardless of suit. Note that all games that build will follow two of these rules, one from each list.</p>
<p><strong>Deck</strong></p>
<p>The set of cards used. Most games use a Standard deck, but games that use a Double deck, a Joker deck, or a Stripped deck are not uncommon.</p>
<p><strong>Double deck</strong></p>
<p>A deck of cards consisting of two Standard decks making a total of 104 cards.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong></p>
<p>If a game has a foundation, the game is usually won by placing all the cards in the foundation pile(s).</p>
<p><strong>Joker deck</strong></p>
<p>A deck of cards consisting of a Standard deck and two jokers making a total of 54 cards.</p>
<p><strong>Pile</strong></p>
<p>A designated area where cards can exist.</p>
<p><strong>Rank</strong></p>
<p>The value of the card. Numbered cards usually have the rank of the associated number. Aces can either be high or low. If high, aces are ranked 14. If low, aces are ranked as 1. J, Q, and K are usually ranked 11, 12, and 13 respectively. However, some games may rank these cards as 10. In such a case, a high ace might be ranked as 11.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Cards in the reserve are usually available to play anywhere. Usually cannot be built on.</p>
<p><strong>Slot</strong></p>
<p>See Pile.</p>

These suits can be grouped into two colors, usually black and red. The Clubs and the Spaces are black while the Hearts and the Diamonds are red. AisleRiot allows the possibility of using different decks. In this case, the new colors and/or suits are substituted into this paradigm.</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong></p>
<p>The remainder of the deck after all the original cards have been dealt and are usually kept faced down.</p>
<p><strong>Suit</strong></p>
<p>Four different kinds in a Standard deck. Usually Clubs, Spades, Hearts, and Diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong></p>
