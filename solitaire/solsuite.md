**Tableau**
(4
rows of 13 cards each)

Build all the cards on the
tableau regardless of
suit, doubling the value of the card that is already placed in the corresponding
column. If the double of a card exceeds 13, the excess of the double over 13 denotes the card required.
Example. If the tableau card is a 6, you can play a 12
(Queen) on it. The double of 12 (Queen) is 24. This is 11 more
than 13 and the next required card must be an 11 (Jack). The
vertical sequence of cards is the following:
2, 4, 8, 3, 6, Q (12),
J (11), 9, 5, 10, 7, A

**Game time**: Quick

**Difficulty level**: Medium

**Skill level**: Mostly chance

**Chance of winning**: Low (about 1 in 10)

**Object of the game**: To reach the highest possible score.

**Solitaire Rules**

A card's value is the same as its
rank with the exception of the 10, J, Q and K whose values are zero. If the
sum of the first two cards is higher than 9 you must subtract 10. For example:
6+8 = 14. Your score = 4.

Click on the stock (52 cards) to deal the first 2 cards.

If the sum of the values of the
cards is 9, click on the
waste. The cards
will transfer to the
waste and their
values will be totaled.

If the sum of the values of the
cards is low (for example: 9+2 = 1, value = 1), you can choose
risking the deal of another card or stopping.

If you choose risking the deal of
another card, click on the
stock. If the sum
of the values of the three cards is 10, your score is 0. If it
is higher than 10, subtract 10 and the resulting total is your
score. If it is 9 or lower, that is your score. Continue in this
manner until the
stock is
exhausted.

You win if you score  65
points or more (theoretically the highest score obtainable is
180 points).

# Building Pyramids

**Game time**:
Medium

**Difficulty level**:

**Skill level**:
Mostly chance

**Chance of winning**:
Very low; about 1 in 200; 0.5%

**Object of the game**:
To discard all the cards of the
stock following the rules of the game.

**Solitaire Rules**

Set Up

Each pyramid is formed by 15 cards. At the start of the game, 5
cards are dealt face up to the 5th
row, leaving 10
empty spaces in the above
rows.

**Tableau** (15 piles)

Each pyramid must be built,
row by
row, from bottom to top.

For each pair of cards in a lower
row, place a card with a value equal to the sum of the pair in the
row above.

When the sum exceeds 13, the value of the required card is found by subtracting 13 from the sum (for example, if the sum is 23, that is 10 more than 13, the required card must be a 10).

The following is an example of a complete pyramid:

In the above scheme, the 6 in the 4th
row has been placed above the 10 and the 9 of the 5th
row because 10 + 9 = 19; 19 - 13 = 6.

When a pyramid is complete, it is automatically discarded (to the top-right
pile).

Five more cards are automatically dealt from the
stock to the bottom pyramid
row.

**Difficulty level**: Easy

**Skill level**: Mostly chance

**Chance of winning**: Low (about 1 in 20)

**Object of the game**: To create four suit sequences of 12 cards from Two to King.

**Solitaire Rules**
The whole stock
is dealt in four rows of 13 cards each. Then the four Aces are removed,
creating four gaps in the layout.

**Tableau** (4 rows of 13 cards each)

A gap (four in all) must be filled with the card that is the next highest in rank and of the same suit to the card on the left of the gap. (For example: if a gap opens up to the right of the 10, it
must be filled by the Jack.
The gap and the Jack will exchange places).

A gap in the
first space of a row may be filled with any Two. The player decides which row he will allocate to each
suit.

Because a King is the highest-ranking card, a gap after a King cannot be filled and action is blocked.

**Stock**

After all possible plays have been made (when the Kings block any action), click the
redeal button.

Redeals are performed as follows:

Any Two and the
suit
sequences starting with them are left in place.

All other cards that are out of sequence are removed, shuffled and then dealt to complete the rows.

A gap is left to the immediate right of the cards that are in
suit
sequence in each row (if the only card in place is a Two, a gap is left to the right of it).

If there is no Two in a row, a gap is left in the first place of the row, so that a Two can be moved in.

Two redeals are permitted (three deals in all).

it must be filled with the 5;
the gap and the 5
will exchange places).

A gap in the first

Two. The player decides which
row he will allocate to each
suit.

Because a Ten is the
highest-ranking card, a gap after a Ten cannot be filled and action is
blocked.

of sequence are removed, shuffled and then dealt to complete the
rows.

A gap is left to the
immediate right of the cards that are in
suit sequence in each
row (if the only card in
place is a Two, a gap is left to the right of it).

A gap
(four in all) must be filled with the card that is:

the
next highest in rank and of the same
suit as the
card to the left of the gap. (For example: if a gap opens up to the
right of the 10
, it must be filled with the Jack;
the gap and the Jack
will exchange places).

the
next lowest in rank and of the same
suit as the
card to the right of the gap. (For example: if a gap opens up to the
left of the 5,
it must be filled with the 4;
the gap and the 4
will exchange places).

A gap
in the first
space of a row may be filled with any Two. The player

he will allocate to each suit.

Autoplay is available.

**Tableau** (Seven columns)

Build
down in
alternating colors (for example, a 10
can be played on a Jack).

The top card of each column is available for play to the foundations or to another tableau column.

Any face up card, no matter how deep it is in a column, may be moved to make a build. All covering cards are moved with it as a unit.

Spaces can be filled only with a King, a King–sequence or a King with any covering cards.

The Joker (Seven columns)

Whenever the Joker becomes available, it may be played to a foundation as a "wild" card.

When the natural card (as shown in the label above the foundation) becomes available, it replaces the Joker, which is placed on top of its foundation and becomes available for play.

If no foundation has been started at the time the Joker first becomes available, it must remain in position until an Ace appears.

The Joker can be moved as a single card to any tableau pile. Cards in correct sequence are then built on the Joker.

The Joker, no matter how deep it is in a column, can also be moved along with a sequence under it.

placed before the Queens are placed. For example, if a fourth
Five or Six appears before the fourth Queen (e.g. when only
three Queens are in place), it cannot be positioned on the
foundation but must be dealt to the tableau.

Another Queen appears. It is placed to
the right of the first Queen. Cards are then dealt and placed on
the second Queen until a third Queen appears. Continue in the
same way until the last Queen is dealt and the whole deck is
laid out in 8 piles of varying lengths.

An uncovered Queen is the equivalent
of a temporary space and any available card may be placed on it.

The top card of each pile is available
for play to the
foundations
or to an uncovered Queen.

No building on the tableau.

**Game time**: Long

**Difficulty level**: Hard

**Skill level**: Skill

**Chance of winning**: Low (about 1 in 25)

**Object of the game**:
To arrange the 48 cards into 4
ascending suit
sequences, each
from Ace to Queen, from left to right.

**Solitaire Rules**

The whole stock is dealt in six rows, the first and the second of 8 cards each, the
third, fourth, fifth and sixth of 9 cards each. Then the four Kings are removed, creating
four gaps in the layout (making six gaps in all).

**Tableau** (6 rows)

A gap must be filled with a card from anywhere on the layout provided it is in
suit sequence - either one higher than the card to the left of the gap to which it is being moved, or one lower than the card to the right of the gap - whichever is more
advantageous.

When a gap appears to the right of a Queen, it may be filled with an Ace of different
suit (even if there is not yet a neighboring 2), or with a card one lower in
suit sequence than the card to the right of the gap itself - whichever is more advantageous.

Only one card at a time may be moved.

The game is won if all the cards are arranged into four
ascending suit sequences (each from Ace to Queen) starting with an Ace in the top left-hand corner to a Queen in the extreme
right-hand position of the sixth row. The
suits
can be in any order. Note: The top left-hand card in the first row follows the same rules as the other cards. For example: if the last card in the sixth row is a 4, and the top left-hand space is empty, you can move the 5  to that space.

The entire 48 card sequence "reads", as in reading and writing, from left to right in each row, and from the top row downwards. The first card in the first row follows the last card in the sixth row.

**Difficulty level**: Easy

**Skill level**: Mostly chance

**Chance of winning**: Low (about 1 in 20)

**Object of the game**: Create four suit sequences of twelve cards each, from Two to King.
Set-Up:
The entire stock is dealt in four rows of thirteen cards each. Then the four Aces are removed, creating four gaps in the layout.

**Tableau** (Four rows of twelve cards each)

A gap (four in all) must be filled with the card that is the next highest in rank and of the same suit as the card to the left of the gap. For example, if a gap opens up to the right of the 10, it must be filled with the Jack. The gap and the Jack will exchange places.

A gap in the first space of a row may be filled with any Two. The player decides which row he will allocate to each suit.

Because a King is the highest–ranking card, a gap after a King cannot be filled and action is blocked.

**Stock**

After all possible plays have been made (when the Kings block any action), click the
redeal button.
Redeals are performed as follows:

Any Two and the suit sequences starting with them are left in place.

All other cards that are out of sequence are removed, and without shuffling them, dealt to complete the rows.

A gap is left to the immediate right of the cards that are in suit sequence in each row. If the only card in place is a Two, the gap will be to the right of it.

If there is no Two in a row, a gap is left in the first place of the row, so that a Two can be moved there.

Two redeals are permitted (three deals in all).

**Game time**: Quick

**Difficulty level**: Easy

**Skill level**: Mostly chance

**Chance of winning**: Low (about 1 in 30)

**Object of the game**:
To discard all the cards, except King  and Queen  together.

**Solitaire Rules**

The Q  is dealt face up and the K  is placed at the bottom of the deck.

Deal the cards to the right of the Q  in a horizontal row by clicking on the
stock.

Eliminate one card or two adjacent cards if it is (they are) between a pair of cards of the same
suit or rank. For example:

10   Q   3   5   A   3 
Since the 3  and the 3  are of the same
rank, the 5  and the A  are eliminated, leaving 4 cards:

10   Q   3   3 
The 10  and the 3  are of the same suit, so the Q  and the 3  are eliminated, leaving only 2 cards:

10   3 

If more than two cards lie between a matching pair they cannot be removed, unless they are all of the same
suit, in which case they all go out. For example:

J   7   10   A   2   5   6   K   7 
All the Hearts between the 10  and 7  can be eliminated, leaving 4 cards:

J   7   10   7 
The 10  would the be alone between the 7  and the 7, so the 10  could be eliminated, leaving 3 cards:

J   7   7 

The game is won if, after the entire deck is dealt out, King  and his Queen  are side by side, other cards having been discarded.

a King, a King-sequence or a King with any overlapping cards.

Nothing can be placed on an Ace (a
King cannot move, except to an empty space).

**Object of the game**:
On the tableau, create four suites of thirteen cards each, in a descending suit sequence from King to Ace.

**Tableau**
(Forty-nine cards in seven columns. At the start of the game, seven cards are dealt to each column. In the first four columns, three cards are face down and four face up. In the next three columns, all cards are face up.)

These piles are storage (holding) locations for cards being played to the tableau.

Each pile can hold only one card.

Stock (Three cards face down)

**Game time**: Medium

**Difficulty level**: Medium

**Skill level**: Mostly chance

**Chance of winning**: Very high; about 2 in 3

**Object of the game**: Move all the cards to the foundation.

**Solitaire Rules**
During the deal, if anyone of the reserve cards should be a King, it is placed at the bottom of the stock and substituted with another card from the stock.

**Foundations**  (One pile at the top)

There is only one foundation dealt face up from the beginning.

Build all the
cards onto the foundation
regardless of suit, doubling the value of the card that has just
been played. If the double of a card exceeds 12, the
excess of the double over 13 denotes the card required.

Example. If the foundation
card is a 6, you can play a 12(Queen) on it. The double of 12 (Queen) is 24. This
is 11 more than 13 and the next required card must be a 11 (Jack).
The sequence is the following:
2 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 6 - Queen (12) - Jack (11) - 9 - 5 - 10 - 7 - A

**Object of the game**:
To discard all combinations of cards that total 7 or a multiple of 7.

**Solitaire Rules**

Deal cards, one at a time, by clicking on the stock.

Discard any combination (doublets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.) of adjacent cards totaling 7 or a multiple of 7 (14, 21, 28, 35, etc.). Discard Sevens singularly.

Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12, Kings count as 13 and Aces count as 1.

Note about the number 7:

In a suite of 13 cards the total number of
rank values amounts to 91. This divided by 7, gives the number of cards in the
suite (13). In an entire deck the number of
rank values is 364, and this divided by 7 gives 52, the number of cards in a full deck. The average value of a card, therefore, counting by
rank, is 7.

**Game time**: Quick

**Difficulty level**: Easy

**Skill level**: Chance only

**Chance of winning**: Very low (about
1 in 50)

**Object of the game**:
To reorganize the cards by turning them face up in the right piles (so
that all the aces are in the first pile, the deuces in the second, and
so on) before the fourth King appears.Solitaire Rules

**Tableau** (12 piles of 4 cards each
numbered from "1" to "12")

At the
start of the game, the top card of the
reserve pile
(13) is turned up and the journeys of the different cards commence.
Place this card on top of the pile which corresponds to its rank or number. For example, an Ace would be placed on top of
the pile numbered one (1), a 9 on top of the pile numbered nine (9) and
so on.

Jacks
count as 11, Queens 12, and all the other cards according to their face
value.

As there
must never be more than four cards in one pile, the bottom card of the
pile where a card has just been placed automatically turns up and
becomes a "Traveller". To continue playing, place it on top of the pile
of its own rank
or number.

Keep
repeating this process until a King appears. In this game there is no
room for Kings, so discard the King to the reserve pile (13) and continue with the next "Traveller" card
from the reserve
pile (13).

When the
fourth card of any group is turned up, and there is no face down card to
turn over, the top card of the next higher pile is automatically turned
up.

The game
is lost if the reserve
pile (13) is used up, or the fourth King appears before all the other
face down cards have been turned up, or trasmuted into four-of-a-kind.
This is because the "Travellers" have been used up and there is no other
card in their pile to continue the game. The game can only be won if the
last card to be turned up is the fourth King.

**Reserve** (1 extra pile of 4 cards numbered "13": the "Travellers")

Kings are discarded here.
