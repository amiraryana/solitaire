Tableau (4 rows of 13 cards each)

    Build all the cards on the tableau regardless of suit, doubling the value of the card that is already placed in the corresponding column. If the double of a card exceeds 13, the excess of the double over 13 denotes the card required.
    Example. If the tableau card is a 6, you can play a 12 (Queen) on it. The double of 12 (Queen) is 24. This is 11 more than 13 and the next required card must be an 11 (Jack). The vertical sequence of cards is the following:
    2, 4, 8, 3, 6, Q (12), J (11), 9, 5, 10, 7, A
