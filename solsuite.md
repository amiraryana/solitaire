Chance of winning: Low (about 1 in 10)
Object of the game: To reach the highest possible score.

Solitaire Rules

A card's value is the same as its rank with the exception of the 10, J, Q and K whose values are zero. If the sum of the first two cards is higher than 9 you must subtract 10. For example: 6+8 = 14. Your score = 4.

Click on the stock (52 cards) to deal the first 2 cards.

If the sum of the values of the cards is 9, click on the waste. The cards will transfer to the waste and their values will be totaled.

If the sum of the values of the cards is low (for example: 9+2 = 1, value = 1), you can choose risking the deal of another card or stopping.

If you choose risking the deal of another card, click on the stock. If the sum of the values of the three cards is 10, your score is 0. If it is higher than 10, subtract 10 and the resulting total is your score. If it is 9 or lower, that is your score. Continue in this manner until the stock is exhausted.

You win if you score 65 points or more (theoretically the highest score obtainable is 180 points).

Game info: Mathematical games type; 1 deck (52 cards); 3 redeals

Game time: Medium
Difficulty level: Easy
Skill level: Mostly chance
Chance of winning: Very low; about 1 in 200; 0.5%
Object of the game: To discard all the cards of the stock following the rules of the game.

Solitaire Rules

Set Up

Each pyramid is formed by 15 cards. At the start of the game, 5 cards are dealt face up to the 5th row, leaving 10 empty spaces in the above rows.

Tableau (15 piles)

Each pyramid must be built, row by row, from bottom to top.

For each pair of cards in a lower row, place a card with a value equal to the sum of the pair in the row above.

When the sum exceeds 13, the value of the required card is found by subtracting 13 from the sum (for example, if the sum is 23, that is 10 more than 13, the required card must be a 10).

The following is an example of a complete pyramid:



In the above scheme, the 6 in the 4th row has been placed above the 10 and the 9 of the 5th row because 10 + 9 = 19; 19 - 13 = 6.

When a pyramid is complete, it is automatically discarded (to the top-right pile).

Five more cards are automatically dealt from the stock to the bottom pyramid row.

Reserve (3 piles)
