The rules state that you can move only one card at a time. But as a shortcut, BVS Solitaire will allow you to move a full or partial build if there are enough empty tableau and empty cells, because you would have been able to get the same result by temporarily moving the extra cards into the empty tableaus.

# Empire Solitaire

1 deck. Easy. No redeal.

**Empire Solitaire**  requires only 18 cards out of a standard deck of 52. The remaining cards are set aside and not used in the game.15 cards are dealt face up in 3 horizontal rows (not overlapping) of 5 cards each. The remaining 3 cards are placed face down in a stack.

**The object of the game**

To get all your cards in a single stack, by placing cards on top of others with the same suit or rank.

**The rules**

You may place any card on top of any card adjacent to it (including diagonally) with the same rank or suit (thereby "conquering" it). Once a card has been conquered, it is out of play.

In addition to immediately adjacent cards, a card can be conquered if it is the same row or column and there are no cards between the card being played and the card being conquered (this is analogous to the movement of the rook in chess).

It is not necessary to work with only a single stack. For example, you may conquer the card in row 1, column 1 by the card in row 2, column 1, then in the next move, conquer the card in row 2, column 5 by the card in row 3, column 4. Play continues in this fashion until there is only one stack of cards containing the entire set (or a single card remaining on the board if conquered cards are being removed from play).

In addition to the 15 face-up cards, the 3 face-down "reserve" cards in the stack pile must also be played. At any time during the game, the player may choose to turn over a card from the stock pile to the waste pile. At this time, the opened must be placed face-up on any empty space in the playing area that was previously occupied by one of the original 15 face-up cards. When a card from the stock pile is turned over, no more moves can be made until it is placed on the board. Once this card is placed on the playing area, it is played like any other card. All 3 cards must be played from the stock pile during the course of the game. (Obviously, you cannot turn over a card from the stock as your first move, because there isn't yet any place to play it as no face-up cards have been moved.)

**The strategy:**
Though the game is very simple to play, it takes some strategic planning to win. Conquering cards with no forethought will quickly deplete you of options.

The layout of cards on the field should be studied carefully before any moves are made. If there is only one spade on the board, for example, that card can only be conquered using its rank, unless a spade is uncovered in the reserves. If the lone spade is conquered, and later a reserve is turned over that is also a spade, you may not be able to conquer that reserve card, unless it shares a rank with another card on the board.

Generally, reserves should be used about midway through the game. Used too early they probably won't provide any real assistance. Used too late and you may not be able to conquer them. If you get stuck, placing a reserve in a strategic location can help.

Try to keep cards of the same rank on the board as long as possible. Three (or even four!) cards of the same rank is ideal. They can each move around the board conquering cards by suit, then later can conquer each other using rank.

This game was invented by Jim Owen.

**40 Thieves Strategy Tips**

-   The first thing to do is to empty at least one tableau pile as early as possible. Take a little extra time and think several moves ahead. Focus on finding the tableau pile that you have the best chances to make empty.
-   You should aim to uncover low cards trapped under high cards (especially kings) as soon as possible and move them to the Foundations.
-   You should especially try to get the kings out of tableaus to unblock the cards trapped under them. Either clear them to foundations or move them to the empty columns.
-   The rules state that you can move only one card at a time. But if there are enough empty spaces you can use them to move partial builds from one pile to another (like in Freecell).
-   Avoid moving cards from the waste if the same card is already blocking a tableau.

**40 Thieves Solitaire**  is also known under different names such as  **Napoleon at St. Helena**,  **Roosevelt at San Juan**  and  **Cadran**.

Klondike Solitaire type games

**Histary**
Klondike Solitaire was invented by Richard Canfield or likely by one of his assistants as a game for his Saratoga resort in 1899. The rules were more severe than those of modern implementations. Canfield named it after the Klondike gold Rush, which took place at that time. Some people think the game existed before in some form and Canfield just adopted it.

You can move the top card from pile to pile (to follow suit in reverse order). You can move either a single card or a set of cards.

When you have made all the moves initially available, click the stock pile to begin turning cards over. The card that is face up on top of the deck is always available for play. You can move the top card from the stock pile to the King's row (to follow suit in order of rank) or to one of tableau piles (to follow suit in reverse order). When a tableau becomes empty, you can place any card, available for play, in the space. As soon as you build up the suit so that the Queen is on top, the imprisoned card becomes free. You can move this card only onto the King's row (you cannot move it onto any tableau pile). When you have made all the available moves on the board and you still have cards in the stock you can turn it over two more times. You win when all cards are on the King's row.

# Spider Solitaire - Winning Strategy

**Spider Solitaire**  is one of the most popular solitaire card games in the world. It is often named Classic Solitaire Game and “the King of all solitaires”.

Spider Solitaire is a lot of fun and has to be learned like any game. At first glance, this challenging and time-consuming game seems to be too complicated. But spider solitaire is a very easy game to play once you get the hang of it.

Not every game of Spider Solitaire can be won, but you have a better chance of winning if you plan your strategy carefully. Below you will find several simple rules that can increase your chances of winning Spider Solitaire (4 Suits).

1.  Build sequences of cards by following suit. Whenever you have a choice, prefer building in suit (“natural builds”). Natural build may be moved as a unit to be built elsewhere. This allows you to expose a hidden face down card, which you may now turn over, or expose an empty pile.
1.  Try to expose hidden cards whenever possible. Uncovering hidden cards leads to a new set of possible moves. Besides, it is a way to get empty pile.
1.  Try to make empty piles as early as possible. Move cards from tableaus that have fewer cards. Use empty piles as temporary storage when rearranging cards sequences into “natural” builds as far as possible. Move cards to empty spaces to turn over more cards.
1.  Build on higher cards first. Among the “out of suit” builds, start with those of highest rank. The reason for this is apparent. You can not move “out of suit” build as a unit to another pile. So this build is of no use except as a temporary storage for cards from other piles. If we start with low card, the build will be finished with an Ace very quickly and then it will be useless. Starting from higher cards allows us to get maximum advantage from it.
1.  Get as many cards exposed and arranged in suit order as possible before dealing the next 10 cards from the stock. Otherwise your chances of winning are significantly reduced.
1.  As soon as you remove a suit, arrange the remaining cards into “natural builds”. Use empty piles as temporary storage when rearranging cards.

After spending some time practicing this strategy you soon will find yourself beating Spider Solitaire faster and more often.
